negative	0.28125	0.25	\*  My  first  biggest  problem  is  that  the  main  navigation  key  is  badly  designed  .

negative	0.375	0.25	\*  My  second  biggest  problem  with  this  phone  is 
negative	0.125	0.25	when  the  slider  is  on  , 
negative	0.625	0.0001	the  screen  light  does  not  come  up  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	So  you  wo  n't  know  -  even  in  the  day  -

positive	0.375	0.5	\*  Slider  lock  and  unlock  feature  is  good  and  bad  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	I  am 
negative	0.625	0.125	putting  this  on  the  bad  section  as  even  if  the  slider  opens  in  your  pocket  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	the  phone  could  turn  on 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  end  up  with  accidental  redialing  . 
negative	0.3125	0.25	So  you  would  need  a  small  app

positive	0.0001	0.75	Overall  -  good  phone  .

negative	0.1875	0.25	Using  a  Chemex  requires  water  to  be  heated  in  a  tea  kettle  prior  to  brewing  ,

negative	0.4375	0.25	After  the  water  is  brought  to  a  boil  , 
negative	0.0001	0.875	it  's  important  to  wait  for  it  to  cool  just  slightly

negative	0.375	0.3333333333333333	Oftentimes  ,  the  most  aggressive  criticism  of  the  Chemex  is  its  ponderousness

negative	0.2916666666666667	0.28125	However  ,  due  to  the  padding  and  the  nature  of  the  metal  materials  ,  the  case  is  very  thick  and  bulky  - 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	when  using  the  belt  clip  ,  the  phone  sticks  out  far

negative	0.0001	0.0001	but  leans  at  an  angle  . 
negative	0.125	0.3125	BUT  ,  the  deciding  factor  in  my  two-star  rating  is  that  this  case  was  the  cause  of  the  only  two  times  I  have  dropped  my  Cingular  8525  -LRB- 
negative	0.375	0.25	which  at  such  a  steep  price  ,  is  not  something 
negative	0.0001	0.125	I  like  to  drop  -RRB-  . 
negative	0.625	0.0001	The  problem  lies  with  the  snap-shut  system

negative	0.125	0.25	Because  the  metal  is  so  thin  ,

negative	0.125	0.0001	To  fix  this  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  simply  bent  the  piece  of  metal  downward  and  towards  the  phone  , 
negative	0.4166666666666667	0.1875	so  that  it  was  much  harder  to  both  open  and  close  the  case  . 
positive	0.625	0.0001	This  ,  for  the  most  part  ,  solves  the  problem  , 
negative	0.3333333333333333	0.25	but  it  is  still  dangerous 
negative	0.125	0.3125	and  caution  is  DEFINATELY  in  order  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	My  favorite  thing  about  this  case  is  that  you  can  open  the  case 
positive	0.375	0.375	and  slide  the  keyboard  open  without  actually  taking  the  phone  out  of  the  case  . 
positive	0.125	0.5625	This  is  nice

negative	0.1875	0.1875	I  am  currently  looking  for  a  soft  case  ,  preferably  a  leather  sleeve  case  that  I  can  just  pull  my  phone  out  of  off  of  my  hip  , 
negative	0.5	0.5	rather  than  bother  with  a  clip  anymore  .

negative	0.625	0.1875	I  seriously  do  not  believe

negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  'd  say 
negative	0.0001	0.1875	it  takes  upward  of  2  seconds  to  get  in  properly 
negative	0.0001	0.75	-LRB-  before  you  `  re  good  and  practiced  at  it  -RRB-  , 
negative	0.625	0.0001	which  may  not  sound  like  a  lot  , 
negative	0.0001	0.125	but  it  's  long  enough 
negative	0.625	0.0001	to  not  recognize  somebody  's  voice  or  hear  the  first  sentence  they  say  ,  or  whatever  . 
negative	0.16666666666666666	0.1875	A  \*  very  mild  \*  frustration  . 
positive	0.125	0.6875	But  like  all  things  good  and  pleasant  , 
positive	0.25	0.25	it  takes  a  little  practice 
positive	0.25	0.20833333333333331	to  get  it  just  right  and  now  I  have  it  so  that  I  can  answer  the  phone  ,  slip  the  EarBoom  in  my  ear 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  start  a  conversation 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	without  missing  a  beat  . 
positive	0.4375	0.25	In  fact  ,  I  find  this  earpiece  to  be  so  comfortable 
positive	0.0001	0.25	that  I  forget 
positive	0.25	0.0001	that  it  's  in  until  I  go  to  scratch  my  ear  or  something  ! 
negative	0.46875	0.3333333333333333	The  other  complaint  that  I  saw  on  here  was  that  it  's  not  compatible  with  Nokia  phones  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	In  fact  , 
negative	0.0001	0.125	it  even  says 
negative	0.0001	0.25	right 
negative	0.625	0.5	on  the  package  that  it  's  not  compatible  with  Nokia  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	That  's  funny  , 
positive	0.0001	0.25	I  have  a  Nokia  3589i 
positive	0.125	0.0001	and  it  works  just  fine  . 
negative	0.625	0.0001	They  make  two  other  models  of  EarBoom 
negative	0.4375	0.25	-LRB-  one  of  which  clearly  would  not  have  worked  with  my  phone  -RRB-  , 
negative	0.125	0.2916666666666667	both  of  which  claim  to  be  Nokia  compatible  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  \*  neither  \*  of  those  works  with  my  phone  ! 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Confusing  ? 
negative	0.0001	0.25	Yes  ! 
negative	0.375	0.25	The  problem  is  it  does  n't  work  with  \*  all  \*  Nokia  phones  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	While  browsing  at  the  store 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  noticed  that  the  ones 
positive	0.125	0.3333333333333333	that  claimed  to  be  Nokia  compatible  had  a  list  of  phones 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	that  it  works  with  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	but  it  did  n't  include  mine 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB-  it  included  one 
positive	0.1875	0.25	that  was  ,  numerically  speaking  ,  very  close  to  my  model  : 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	the  3590  -RRB-  ; 
positive	0.375	0.125	which  piqued  my  curiosity  . 
positive	0.125	0.375	And  so  I  went  to  the  friendly  manager  of  the  store  that  I  was  in  and  he  opened  two  of  the  different  packages  for  me 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  let 
positive	0.0001	0.375	me  test  both  of  them  . 
negative	0.625	0.0001	One  of  them  worked  ,  the  other  did  n't  . 
positive	0.375	0.20833333333333331	The  strange  part  of  it  was  that  we  could  n't  see  a  visible  difference  in  the  two  units  .  .  . 
positive	0.2916666666666667	0.1875	and  then  one  of  us  noticed  that  on  one  of  them  the  jack  had  two  small  black  stripes  around  it 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB-  that  's  this  one  ,  and  if  you  look  closely  at  the  picture 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	you  can  see  them  -RRB-  , 
positive	0.625	0.0001	while  the  other  one 
positive	0.0001	0.5	-LRB-  the  one  marked  as  Nokia  compatible  -RRB- 
positive	0.0001	0.25	had  three  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Hmmm  .  .  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Curious  . 
positive	0.125	0.4166666666666667	So  my  advice  is  to  either  know  your  phone  well 
positive	0.375	0.25	-LRB-  as  in  ,  have  the  little  book  handy  -RRB- 
positive	0.0001	0.5	or  ask  for  help 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	before  purchasing  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	All  in  all  4  of  5  stars  . 
positive	0.3125	0.125	I  'd  give  it  5  stars  on  performance  and  comfort  , 
negative	0.125	0.15625	but  have  to  take  it  down  a  notch  for  an  extended  period  of  getting  used  to  it  and  for  confusing  packaging  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Addendum  : 
negative	0.375	0.25	Several  months  later  the  little  piece  of  foam  has  fallen  from  the  end  of  the  boom  so  that  any  sound  from  the  wind  becomes  almost  unbearably  loud  for  the  person  at  the  other  end  .  .  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	And  living  in  windy  Providence  , 
negative	0.125	0.25	this  is  a  bit  of  an  annoyance  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Also  ,  for  a  while 
negative	0.375	0.25	I  was  having  a  problem 
negative	0.625	0.125	where  the  earpiece  would  cut  out  for  seconds  at  a  time  so  that  I  could  n't  hear  the  person  on  the  other  end  of  the  line 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB-  and  ,  likewise  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	they  could  n't  hear  me  -RRB- 
negative	0.25	0.125	unless  I  jiggled  the  little  jack  . 
negative	0.1875	0.25	This  was  \*  very  \*  FRUSTRATING  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	\*\* 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Now  ,  for  some  reason  , 
negative	0.625	0.25	I  'm  not  having  that  problem  anymore  . 
negative	0.46875	0.375	I  'm  not  really  sure  if  the  problem  was  due  to  my  phone  or  the  EarBoom  . 
negative	0.125	0.375	Either  way  ,  it  's  something  buyers  should  be  aware  of 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	"It  's  a  three-piece  roasting  rack  --  two  sides  and  a  long  ""  pin  "" "
positive	0.0001	0.0001	that  holds  them  together  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	When  assembled 
positive	0.125	0.375	it  has  a  rounded  bottom  and  tall  sides  with  handles  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	It  's  supposed  to  handle  up  to  a  25  lb  turkey  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and 
positive	0.0001	0.125	after  using  it  with  a  22  lb  turkey  I  believe  that  claim  . 
positive	0.0001	0.5	The  tall  sides  and  handles  make 
positive	0.25	0.625	it  easy 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	to  remove  your  turkey  from  your  roasting  pan  , 
positive	0.1875	0.25	and  the  wide  rounded  base  holds  the  turkey  nicely  up  out  of  the  drippings  without  crushing  the  rib  cage 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	the  way  angled 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	racks  do  . 
negative	0.225	0.3125	In  fact  ,  my  only  beef  with  the  shape  was  that  it  was  too  wide  to  fit  in  our  Maxam  Steel  Roaster  , 
negative	0.125	0.25	which  is  currently  my  favorite  roasting  pan  . 
positive	0.25	0.3125	The  truly  cool  thing  about  this  rack  ,  however  ,  is  n't  the  handles  or  the  shape  . 
positive	0.125	0.0001	It  's  that  nifty  pin  at  the  bottom  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	You  see  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	you  just  put  your  racked  turkey  down  on  its  carving  platter 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  pull  the  pin  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	then 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	you  simply  remove  the  sides  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	That  's  it  . 
positive	0.0001	0.25	They  pull  right  away  from  the  turkey  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	leaving  it  behind  on  its  platter  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	No  more  trying  to  lever  it  out  of  your  pan  or  off  of  its  rack  ; 
positive	0.0001	0.25	it  's  right 
positive	0.0001	0.1875	where  you  want  it  already  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	For  all  of  its  non-stick  properties  the  rack  did  take  some  real  elbow-grease 
negative	0.125	0.0001	to  clean  --  particularly 
negative	0.0001	0.125	when  trying  to  get  turkey  goo  out  of  the  crevices  between  bars  -- 
positive	0.3333333333333333	0.25	but  that  is  n't  very  surprising  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	It  does  make 
negative	0.34375	0.1875	it  unfortunate  that  the  dishwasher  is  not  recommended  for  this  product  ,  however  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Also  , 
negative	0.375	0.25	there  is  one  problem 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	that  did  bother  us  ; 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	it  seems 
negative	0.125	0.0001	that  some  of  the  non-stick  coating  at  the  bottom  of  the  rack  flaked  off  during  cooking  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	We  thought 
negative	0.20833333333333331	0.16666666666666666	that  perhaps  the  initial  30  minutes  at  500  F  was  too  high  a  temperature  for  the  rack  , 
negative	0.1875	0.25	but  there  is  no  maximum  temperature 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	listed  on  the  packaging  that  I  could  find  . 
positive	0.125	0.0001	I  'm  still  giving  this  item  a  rating  of  four 
positive	0.3125	0.1875	because  it  's  just  so  incredibly  cool  an  idea  ,  and  so  remarkably  useful  , 
negative	0.0001	0.1875	but  I  have  to  admit 
negative	0.625	0.125	that  I  'm  not  thrilled  with  the  idea  of  a  non-stick  coating 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	that  flakes  , 
negative	0.375	0.125	and  I  wish 
negative	0.125	0.25	the  item  was  dishwasher-safe  . 
negative	0.0001	0.5	I  'd  love  to  see  Cuisipro  develop  a  version  of  this  item 
negative	0.0001	0.875	made  out  of  a  better  material 
positive	0.125	0.25	I  think  this  may  be  a  great  product  , 
positive	0.125	0.25	and  is  why  I  bought  it  . 
negative	0.5	0.125	However  ,  mine  NEVER  worked 
negative	0.375	0.3125	-LRB-  and  hence  was  never  actually  used  , 
negative	0.125	0.25	it  was  just  taken  out  of  the  box  !  -RRB- 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	The  remote  would  beep  the  collar 
negative	0.625	0.0001	but  not  spray  . 
negative	0.0001	0.3125	Seller  did  have  manufacturer  send  new  batteries 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB- 
negative	0.0001	0.125	which  further  delayed  my 
negative	0.0001	0.4375	getting  a  good  response  to  this  situation  -RRB-  . 
negative	0.125	0.0001	New  batteries  arrived  ,  item  still  did  n't  spray  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	but  seller  would  only  refer  me  to  dealing  directly  with  the  manufacturer  , 
negative	0.0001	0.125	to  get  a  replacement  , 
negative	0.0001	0.125	even  though  I  responded 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	within  their  advertised  30  day  return  policy  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Please  read  seller  information  and  return  policies  CAREFULLY  ! 
negative	0.0001	0.125	Even  if  you  get 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	them  to  take  something  back 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB- 
negative	0.625	0.0001	only  if  never  opened  .  .  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	if  opened  and  does  n't  work  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	they  toss 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	you 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  the  manufacturer  -RRB-  , 
negative	0.125	0.25	there  is  a  25  %  RESTOCKING  FEE  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ! 
negative	0.375	0.175	Pretty  exorbitant  and  not  Amazon  type  service  I  have  come  to  expect  over  many  years  of  buying  from  Amazon  ! 
negative	0.1875	0.3333333333333333	Be  very  careful  of  sellers 
negative	0.3125	0.25	that  are  not  Amazon  .  .  .  sometimes  it  is  n't  very  clear  it  is  not  Amazon  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	My  feedback  on  Seller  is  on  feedback  page  and  seller  responded  , 
negative	0.0001	0.3125	but  I  do  n't  get  a  chance 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  respond  to  their  feedback  , 
negative	0.375	0.25	which  gives  the  misconception 
negative	0.0001	0.375	that  I  actually  used  this  product  ! 
negative	0.0001	0.25	I  could  n't  have  used  it 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	as  it  did  n't  work  ! 
negative	0.0001	0.25	If  you  want  to  buy  this  , 
negative	0.25	0.875	I  'd  recommend  a  reputable  pet  store  such  as  Pet  Smart 
negative	0.0001	0.1875	where  you  can  easily  take  an  item  back  if  it  does  n't  work  and  get  a  refund  . 
negative	0.3125	0.2916666666666667	Even  if  they  are  willing  to  replace  something  , 
negative	0.40625	0.25	you  may  not  want  to  risk  having  future  problems  with  it  in  a  month  or  two 
negative	0.0001	0.25	and  would  want  a  refund  , 
negative	0.625	0.25	which  most  stores  have  no  problem  with  doing  for  you  . 
negative	0.125	0.0001	Next  time  I  go  the  established  pet  stores 
positive	0.125	0.25	I  have  been  using  a  Chemex  10-cup  coffee  maker  for  almost  a  year 
positive	0.625	0.4166666666666667	and  have  never  had  such  good  coffee  before  in  my  life  . 
positive	0.1875	0.20833333333333331	I  am  constantly  looking  forward  to  my  next  pot  of  coffee  ! 
negative	0.125	0.1875	There  is  a  downside  to  this  coffee  maker  : 
negative	0.125	0.25	it  is  a  more  manual  procedure  than  what  you  are  used  to  , 
negative	0.125	0.0001	and  it  also  takes  a  couple  of  pots 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  learn 
negative	0.0001	0.25	how  to  use  this  most  efficiently  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	The  first  time  I  tried  to  use  mine  , 
negative	0.25	0.1875	I  had  ground  my  coffee  way  too  finely  and  it  just  took  forever  ! 
negative	0.125	0.25	The  big  time  consumers  : 
negative	0.0001	0.25	you  have  to  boil  your  water  separately 
negative	0.0001	0.25	-LRB-  you  do  have  a  water  kettle  right  ?  -RRB- 
negative	0.0001	0.25	and  then  you  have  to  gradually  pour  the  boiled  water  through  the  Chemex  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	This  means  that  while  the  coffee  is  brewing  , 
negative	0.125	0.1875	you  are  pouring  ,  or  watching  ,  or  giving  the  filter  area  a  bit  of  a  stir  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Now  the  up  side  : 
positive	0.625	0.875	you  will  never  ever  ever  drink  a  better  cup  of  coffee  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  use  filtered  water  ,  freshly  ground  home  roasted  beans  ,  and  this  Chemex  to  produce  the  finest  coffee 
positive	0.0001	0.25	I  have  ever  had  the  pleasure  of  drinking  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	And  this  coffee  is  a  pleasure  ! 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	In  fact  , 
positive	0.125	0.375	I  `  ve  totally  given  up  using  cream  and  sugar 
positive	0.125	0.25	because  my  coffee  no  longer  has  anything  to  hide  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Another  up  side  : 
positive	0.375	0.5	clean  up  means 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	swishing  the  Chemex  with  warm  water 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  tossing  the  water  down  the  drain  . 
positive	0.125	0.0001	You  can  also  wash  with  a  bottle  brush 
positive	0.125	0.4375	but  this  is  rarely  necessary  . 
positive	0.125	0.4375	A  brief  swish  is  really  all 
positive	0.0001	0.125	it  takes  to  get  your  Chemex 
positive	0.0001	0.375	looking  factory  new  . 
positive	0.0001	0.125	Try  that  with  your  electric  drip  machine  ! 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Ha  ! 
positive	0.625	0.375	That  thing  will  NEVER  look  brand  new  ! 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Oh  ,  here  's  a  final  upside  : 
positive	0.0001	0.75	this  Chemex  brews  the  best  coffee 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	you  `  ll  ever  drink  , 
positive	0.5	0.0001	and  it  costs  less  than  just  about  anything  . 
positive	0.125	0.1875	You  are  probably  already  spending  more  money  than  this  every  month  at  Starbucks  ! 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Go  ahead 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  buy  yourself  one  of  these  . 
positive	0.0001	0.625	If  necessary  ,  wake  up  10  minutes  earlier  to  make  your  coffee  . 
positive	0.0001	0.375	Better  yet  ,  wake  up  20  minutes  earlier  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	And 
positive	0.125	0.25	when  your  coffee  is  ready  ,  instead  of  dumping  it  into  a  travel  cup 
positive	0.125	0.0001	and  bolting  out  the  door  ,  sit  down 
positive	0.0001	0.375	and  enjoy  your  first  cup  for  the  next  10  minutes  . 
positive	0.125	0.75	You  deserve  it 
negative	0.125	0.4166666666666667	These  big  internet  companies  are  so  good  at  screwing  their  companies  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Do  you  see 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	how

negative	0.625	0.375	"They  sell  ""  FRESH  WHOLE  RABBIT  "" "
