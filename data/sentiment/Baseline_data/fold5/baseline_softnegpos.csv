negative	0.375	0.1875	"The  last  design  defect  of  the  6011i  humidifier  is  that  the  water  containers  and  humidifier  fan  housing  do  not  just  ""  drop  into  place  ""  on  the  base  . "
negative	0.125	0.2916666666666667	One  must  use  one  hand  as  a  guide  for  the  water  container  and  then  still  fiddle  with  the  position\/angle  of  the  water  container  to  get  it  to  seat  properly  . 
negative	0.3333333333333333	0.20833333333333331	This  is  even  more  difficult  if  both  water  containers  are  removed  for  filling  at  the  same  time  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  bought  this  6011i  humidifier 
negative	0.5	0.0001	to  replace  a  Honeywell  humidifier

positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  also  selected  the  6011i  Humidifier 
positive	0.0001	0.5	because  of  its  many  desirable  features  . 
negative	0.3125	0.34375	However  the  positive  product  features  were  significantly  outweighed  by  the  poor  quality  control  and  the  poor  design  of  the  6011i  Humidifier  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	I  believe 
negative	0.325	0.3125	that  a  humidifier  should  be  designed  for  usability  first  and  esthetics  second  ,  not  the  other  way  around  as  is  the  case  with  the  6011i  humidifier  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Thus  I  returned  the  6011i  humidifier

positive	0.0001	0.25	I  would  have  purchased  one  of  those  , 
positive	0.0001	0.5	except  I  did  n't  really  care  about  a  camera  for  my  phone  , 
positive	0.1875	0.1875	and  this  one  was  reasonably  priced  .  .  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  I  found  out 
negative	0.0001	0.125	you  get 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	what  you  pay  for  ! 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	The  i560  felt  almost  cheap  in  construction

negative	0.125	0.25	I  had  it  for  a  couple  of  weeks 
negative	0.1875	0.375	when  I  started  having  trouble  with  the  clarity  of  my  calls  - 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  could  hear  them  ,

negative	0.125	0.5	A  couple  of  times  , 
negative	0.0001	0.25	I  had  the  screen  go  to  Airplane  Mode  , 
negative	0.0001	0.1875	even  when  I  had  n't  touched  it  . 
negative	0.0001	0.1875	The  fact  that  you  had  to  take  the  whole  phone  out 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  see 
negative	0.16666666666666666	0.2	who  is  calling  was  another  downside  ,  too  .

negative	0.375	0.0001	Not  a  great  design  for  this  holster  . 
negative	0.375	0.25	Another  problem  is  with  the  power  supply  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	When  charging  the  phone  , 
negative	0.25	0.425	it  is  especially  important  to  make  sure  the  plug  is  seated  tight  -  and  to  check

negative	0.125	0.25	Then  I  am  on  a  phone  call  on  speakerphone

negative	0.0001	0.0001	Michell 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	So  I  bought  this  thing 
positive	0.0001	0.125	based  on  the  Amazon  reviews 
positive	0.0001	0.5	and  saved  a  bundle  over  the  local  retail  cost 
positive	0.0001	0.125	-LRB-  yeah  Amazon  !  -RRB-  , 
positive	0.625	0.0001	but  that  's  not 
positive	0.0001	0.125	why  I  'm  writing  this  review  . 
positive	0.5	0.125	I  'd  like  to  talk  about  the  performance  and  comfort  of  the  Earboom  . 
positive	0.375	0.34375	The  eargel  thingies  are  designed  quite  well  ,  of  the  three  different  sizes  for  each  ear 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	you  `  re  bound  to  find  one 
positive	0.1875	0.5	that  fits  very  comfortably  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Turns  out  I  could  n't  find  any 
negative	0.25	0.125	that  fit  my  right  ear  comfortably  for  extended  periods  of  use 
positive	0.5625	0.0001	but  found  a  perfect  fit  in  my  mate  on  the  other  side  . 
negative	0.0001	0.375	My  wife  had  the  exact  opposite  experience  -  hopefully  our  daughter  will  inherit  more  symmetrical  ears  ! 
positive	0.625	0.125	I  hate  jogging  so  ca  n't  comment  on  the  fit  during  that  activity 
positive	0.0001	0.75	but  can  say  the  gels  fit 
positive	0.0001	0.25	suprising  well  in  the  folds  of  your  ear 
positive	0.2916666666666667	0.25	and  the  boom  is  quite  secure 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	when  installed  . 
positive	0.5	0.25	I  'd  have  to  imagine 
positive	0.125	0.25	it  'd  take  a  big  hit 
positive	0.0001	0.375	to  knock  it  loose  once  in  place  . 
positive	0.125	0.3125	Sound  quality  from  the  earbud  is  decent  , 
negative	0.25	0.125	but  I  feel 
negative	0.25	0.125	the  Earboom  lacks  some  fidelity  ,  especially  the  higher  frequencies  . 
negative	0.4583333333333333	0.25	Normally  this  is  not  a  problem  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	but  it  can  sometimes  make  the  person 
negative	0.125	0.0001	you  `  re  talking  to  sound  like  Isaac  Hayes  . 
positive	0.16666666666666666	0.175	The  speaker  is  plently  loud  and  the  lack  of  high  frequencies  allows  you  to  tune  into  the  tonal  range 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	where  us  humans  tend  to  converse  , 
positive	0.0001	0.25	without  having  the  voices 
positive	0.125	0.0001	washed  over  with  background  noise  . 
positive	0.375	0.0001	The  gels  block  an  appropriate  amount  of  external  sounds 
positive	0.0001	0.5	allowing  you  to  concentrate  on  the  discussion  at  hand  without  impeding  your  ability 
positive	0.0001	0.125	to  hear  say 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	an  ambulance  while  driving  . 
positive	0.25	0.25	There  is  a  small  slot  on  the  gels 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	that  funnels  some  external  noise  to  your  drum  , 
positive	0.0001	0.75	while  the  rest  of  the  gel  fits  snug  to  the  ear 
positive	0.5	0.0001	blocking  out  other  stray  noise  paths  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  `  ve  asked  people 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	how  I  sound 
positive	0.125	0.375	and  thus  far  the  feedback  has  been  positive  , 
negative	0.125	0.3333333333333333	my  voice  comes  through  loud  and  clear  despite  the  boom  's  apparent  lack  of  length  , 
positive	0.0001	0.125	reinforcing  my  belief 
positive	0.375	0.125	that  size  DOES  N'T  matter  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	In  fact  , 
negative	0.25	0.21875	I  have  found  the  mic  to  be  very  sensitive  to  even  small  sounds  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Forget  talking  on  the  phone 
negative	0.0001	0.125	and  subtly  typing  on  the  keyboard  our  mouse  click  surfing  - 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	they  `  ll  hear  every  click  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Another  example  , 
negative	0.125	0.25	I  was  in  my  house 
negative	0.625	0.0001	and  the  person  on  the  other  end  could  hear  the  kids 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	playing  in  the  pool  40  feet  away 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	with  the  house  windows  closed  !  ! 
negative	0.125	0.25	Yes  ,  the  mic  is  that  sensitive  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	Even  while  driving  they  could  hear 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	when  I  shifted  gears  . 
positive	0.4583333333333333	0.0001	Not  that  it  's  obtrusive  to  the  other  person  on  the  phone  , 
positive	0.125	0.5	it  's  just  good  to  be  aware 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	they  can  hear  it  all  . 
positive	0.375	0.125	What  more  to  say  about  such  a  simple  device  . 
positive	0.25	0.25	Form  Fit  and  Function  are  all  there  and  I  would  recommend  this  product  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	In  fact  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  just  ordered  another  - 
positive	0.0001	0.25	it  makes  a  great  gift
