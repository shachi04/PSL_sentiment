16_kitchen_neg_1	Okay ,
16_kitchen_neg_2	I bought for the price .
16_kitchen_neg_3	And it is effective enough .
16_kitchen_neg_4	But it is very clumsy and unergonomic ,
16_kitchen_neg_5	so that after a couple minutes of use
16_kitchen_neg_6	it is difficult to handle any longer .
16_kitchen_neg_7	The main problems are :
16_kitchen_neg_8	Balance of weight , and the switch .
16_kitchen_neg_9	First , the switch :
16_kitchen_neg_10	Because it is a cheap push-in button ,
16_kitchen_neg_11	which must be constantly depressed to keep the knife on ,
16_kitchen_neg_12	you lose optimum control quickly .
16_kitchen_neg_13	The handle is badly placed for this ,
16_kitchen_neg_14	as your thumb must always be on TOP of the handle and forward toward the front of it ,
16_kitchen_neg_15	but you ca n't hold your hand up there
16_kitchen_neg_16	because your wrist angle will be completely wrong for cutting .
16_kitchen_neg_17	In addition ,
16_kitchen_neg_18	keeping
16_kitchen_neg_19	that button depressed is difficult
16_kitchen_neg_20	not only because it does require a constant application of pressure
16_kitchen_neg_21	at a different direction from both the grasp
16_kitchen_neg_22	and the application of the knife , but because the button sinks deep into the handle , so your thumb is inside the handle as you ` re trying to hold and control the knife :
16_kitchen_neg_23	Quick cramp .
16_kitchen_neg_24	Moreover ,
16_kitchen_neg_25	as you ` re pushing it in ,
16_kitchen_neg_26	if the food you ` re cutting is moist
16_kitchen_neg_27	-LRB- like a turkey -RRB- ,
16_kitchen_neg_28	juices may run onto the handle , your thumb -- and into the hole into which you ` re pressing the button .
16_kitchen_neg_29	NOT safe .
16_kitchen_neg_30	A couple times I ` ve wondered whether that shooting pain in my thumb was from nerve torture or electric shock ;
16_kitchen_neg_31	either way ,
16_kitchen_neg_32	it was n't good .
16_kitchen_neg_33	Then the weight distribution of the knife is not very good .
16_kitchen_neg_34	Look at the huge bulk of the motor --
16_kitchen_neg_35	and then look at where the handle is located , and how it is designed .
16_kitchen_neg_36	There 's no way to hold this at a proper angle with the handle
16_kitchen_neg_37	shaped as it is .
16_kitchen_neg_38	Add in the need to be depressing the power button
16_kitchen_neg_39	as you ` re holding it awkwardly , and . . .
16_kitchen_neg_40	2 stars for effectiveness ;
16_kitchen_neg_41	minus 3 for bad functional design
