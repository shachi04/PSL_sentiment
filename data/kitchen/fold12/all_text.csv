12_kitchen_pos_1	When I adopted a cat a couple of weeks ago , two of my good friends highly recommended Fresh Step Premium Clay Cat Litter .
12_kitchen_pos_2	Here 's why --
12_kitchen_pos_3	This Fresh Step Premium Clay Cat Litter is excellent for your favorite kitty 's litter box .
12_kitchen_pos_4	The company states that it is very good at absorbing odors
12_kitchen_pos_5	--
12_kitchen_pos_6	and , by golly ,
12_kitchen_pos_7	it 's TRUE !
12_kitchen_pos_8	The odors are minimal at the very most and it is quite comfortable even for my rather sensitive cat .
12_kitchen_pos_9	Moreover ,
12_kitchen_pos_10	I really like how the litter has the capacity to absorb and prevent odor
12_kitchen_pos_11	causing bacteria in the litter
12_kitchen_pos_12	before my cat even uses his litter box .
12_kitchen_pos_13	That 's a plus for any cat lover !
12_kitchen_pos_14	If you have more than one cat the manufacturer does recommend , not surprisingly ,
12_kitchen_pos_15	that you use more cat litter in the box .
12_kitchen_pos_16	Otherwise ,
12_kitchen_pos_17	if you have just one cat , two or three inches worth of this cat litter
12_kitchen_pos_18	spread about evenly throughout the empty litter box will do fine .
12_kitchen_pos_19	You should change the entire litter box once a week on average .
12_kitchen_pos_20	-LRB- I change mine about twice a week just for my cat 's comfort . -RRB-
12_kitchen_pos_21	It 's also a good idea
12_kitchen_pos_22	"to scoop out any "" kitty remains """
12_kitchen_pos_23	every other day or so .
12_kitchen_pos_24	"Be very certain NOT to flush any "" kitty presents """
12_kitchen_pos_25	down the toilet as the manufacturer warns against this .
12_kitchen_pos_26	I suppose it could clog toilet pipes .
12_kitchen_pos_27	Moreover ,
12_kitchen_pos_28	as you may suspect ,
12_kitchen_pos_29	"any "" kitty leftovers """
12_kitchen_pos_30	could have some nasty germs
12_kitchen_pos_31	that we do n't want so wash your hands really
12_kitchen_pos_32	"carefully after you clean the box or even after you just remove any "" kitty presents """
12_kitchen_pos_33	with a scooper .
12_kitchen_pos_34	The fact that this is clay litter helps
12_kitchen_pos_35	because you can use a very inexpensive litter scooper
12_kitchen_pos_36	"to remove any "" kitty presents , "" thus reducing the number the times"
12_kitchen_pos_37	you need
12_kitchen_pos_38	to change the entire kitty litter box .
12_kitchen_pos_39	Nevertheless ,
12_kitchen_pos_40	I recommend
12_kitchen_pos_41	changing the entire litter box at least once a week .
12_kitchen_pos_42	Place the contents of the used litter box into a trash bag
12_kitchen_pos_43	and discard as you would any other garbage .
12_kitchen_pos_44	In short ,
12_kitchen_pos_45	this is a great cat litter product at a great price .
12_kitchen_pos_46	The contents of the bag last a long time ,
12_kitchen_pos_47	especially if , like me ,
12_kitchen_pos_48	you have only one cat .
12_kitchen_pos_49	The manufacturer also offers customers
12_kitchen_pos_50	-LRB- us , not the cats -RRB-
12_kitchen_pos_51	"an "" awards "" program with points that you can accumulate in your "" account """
12_kitchen_pos_52	with the company on the company Internet website .
12_kitchen_pos_53	A nice plus !
12_kitchen_pos_54	OK ,
12_kitchen_pos_55	Fresh Step --
12_kitchen_pos_56	I thank you ;
12_kitchen_pos_57	my father and mother thank you ;
12_kitchen_pos_58	and ,
12_kitchen_pos_59	most importantly ,
12_kitchen_pos_60	my CAT says THANK YOU ! ! !
12_kitchen_pos_61	SMILES
