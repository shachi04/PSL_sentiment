I  had  heard 	0.0001
a  lot  of  people  say 	0.0001
that  Motorola  's  hardware  was  very  good  , 	0.1875
but  that  their  software  left  a  lot  to  be  desired  . 	0.125
Nonetheless  I  decided  to  try  this  phone  out 	0.5
when  it  came  time  to  start  a  new  cell  plan  . 	0.0001
I  had  made  the  decision 	0.0001
to  switch  to  T-mobile 	0.0001
and  this  looked  like  one  of  the  best  phone  options  . 	0.25
Right  off  the  bat 	0.0001
I  found  out 	0.0001
that  the  people  who  criticized  Moto  's  software  were  right  on  the  money  . 	0.1875
There  are  a  host  of  poorly  designed  software  aspects  of  this  phone  ,  not  the  least  of  which  is  the  --  frankly  --  idiotic  way 	0.40625
the  phone  book  is  designed  . 	0.125
Eventually  I  made  peace  with  all  of  the  things 	0.0001
I  disliked  about  the  V360  since  at  least  it  seemed  to  work  well  enough  as  a  phone  . 	0.5
As  time  went  by  I  started  noticing 	0.0001
that  I  was  missing  a  lot  of  calls  . 	0.1875
The  phone  would  be  in  my  bag  or  in  my  pocket  or  sitting  on  my  desk 	0.125
when  suddenly  it  would  ring  with  the  voicemail  notification  from  a  message  that  I  had  received  anywhere  from  minutes 	0.0001
to  hours 	0.0001
before  . 	0.0001
During  the  course  of  the  last  few  months 	0.0001
-LRB-  the  phone  is  less  than  a  year  old  -RRB- 	0.3125
I  `  ve  also  found  that  it  has  begun 	0.0001
crashing  . 	0.0001
A  lot  . 	0.0001
"Opening  or  closing  it  will  result  in  a  ""  white  screen  of  death  .  "" "	0.25
Putting  it  on  the  charger  will  cause  it  to  switch  back  and  forth  between  the  messages  that  it  is  charging  , 	0.125
that  it  is  unable  to  charge  and  that  it  's  SIM  card  can  not  be  found  , 	0.40625
after  a  few  minutes 	0.0001
of  which  it  will  simply  shut  itself  off  . 	0.0001
With  a  full  battery  charge  it  will  continually  shut  itself  off  . 	0.0001
At  this  point  I  am 	0.125
forced  to  conclude 	0.125
that  this  phone  is  an  absolute  piece  of  junk  . 	0.25
I  am  also  forced  to  conclude 	0.125
that  it  is  n't  the  only  model 	0.125
which  is  . 	0.125
None  of  my  coworkers  has  ever  had  a  good  experience  with  a  Motorola  phone  . 	0.0001
My  wife  's  Motorola  has  shown  its  own  host  of  problems  . 	0.625
People  working  for  T-mobile  at  several  stores 	0.0001
I  have  visited  have  confided 	0.0001
that  they  never  ,  ever  recommend  Motorola  phones  to  anyone  . 	0.375
In  fact 	0.0001
I  `  ve  had  T-mobile  employees  urge 	0.0001
me  to  not  buy  any  phones  from  them  , 	0.625
but  rather  to  shop  for  an  unlocked  Nokia  online  . 	0.5
So  that  's  what  I  'm  going  to  do  . 	0.0001
Until  I  can  buy  a  new  phone 	0.0001
all  I  can  do  is  recharge  this  phone  every  night  ,  restart  it  five  or  six  times  a  day  , 	0.125
and  keep  apologizing  to  my  friends  ,  family  and  employers  for  always  missing  their  calls 	0.4375
So  I  bought  this  thing 	0.0001
based  on  the  Amazon  reviews 	0.0001
and  saved  a  bundle  over  the  local  retail  cost 	0.0001
-LRB-  yeah  Amazon  !  -RRB-  , 	0.0001
but  that  's  not 	0.625
why  I  'm  writing  this  review  . 	0.0001
I  'd  like  to  talk  about  the  performance  and  comfort  of  the  Earboom  . 	0.5
The  eargel  thingies  are  designed  quite  well  ,  of  the  three  different  sizes  for  each  ear 	0.375
you  `  re  bound  to  find  one 	0.0001
that  fits  very  comfortably  . 	0.1875
Turns  out  I  could  n't  find  any 	0.0001
that  fit  my  right  ear  comfortably  for  extended  periods  of  use 	0.25
but  found  a  perfect  fit  in  my  mate  on  the  other  side  . 	0.5625
My  wife  had  the  exact  opposite  experience  -  hopefully  our  daughter  will  inherit  more  symmetrical  ears  ! 	0.0001
I  hate  jogging  so  ca  n't  comment  on  the  fit  during  that  activity 	0.625
but  can  say  the  gels  fit 	0.0001
suprising  well  in  the  folds  of  your  ear 	0.0001
and  the  boom  is  quite  secure 	0.2916666666666667
when  installed  . 	0.0001
I  'd  have  to  imagine 	0.5
it  'd  take  a  big  hit 	0.125
to  knock  it  loose  once  in  place  . 	0.0001
Sound  quality  from  the  earbud  is  decent  , 	0.125
but  I  feel 	0.25
the  Earboom  lacks  some  fidelity  ,  especially  the  higher  frequencies  . 	0.25
Normally  this  is  not  a  problem  , 	0.4583333333333333
but  it  can  sometimes  make  the  person 	0.0001
you  `  re  talking  to  sound  like  Isaac  Hayes  . 	0.125
The  speaker  is  plently  loud  and  the  lack  of  high  frequencies  allows  you  to  tune  into  the  tonal  range 	0.16666666666666666
where  us  humans  tend  to  converse  , 	0.0001
without  having  the  voices 	0.0001
washed  over  with  background  noise  . 	0.125
The  gels  block  an  appropriate  amount  of  external  sounds 	0.375
allowing  you  to  concentrate  on  the  discussion  at  hand  without  impeding  your  ability 	0.0001
to  hear  say 	0.0001
an  ambulance  while  driving  . 	0.0001
There  is  a  small  slot  on  the  gels 	0.25
that  funnels  some  external  noise  to  your  drum  , 	0.0001
while  the  rest  of  the  gel  fits  snug  to  the  ear 	0.0001
blocking  out  other  stray  noise  paths  . 	0.5
I  `  ve  asked  people 	0.0001
how  I  sound 	0.0001
and  thus  far  the  feedback  has  been  positive  , 	0.125
my  voice  comes  through  loud  and  clear  despite  the  boom  's  apparent  lack  of  length  , 	0.125
reinforcing  my  belief 	0.0001
that  size  DOES  N'T  matter  . 	0.375
In  fact  , 	0.0001
I  have  found  the  mic  to  be  very  sensitive  to  even  small  sounds  . 	0.25
Forget  talking  on  the  phone 	0.0001
and  subtly  typing  on  the  keyboard  our  mouse  click  surfing  - 	0.0001
they  `  ll  hear  every  click  . 	0.0001
Another  example  , 	0.0001
I  was  in  my  house 	0.125
and  the  person  on  the  other  end  could  hear  the  kids 	0.625
playing  in  the  pool  40  feet  away 	0.0001
with  the  house  windows  closed  !  ! 	0.0001
Yes  ,  the  mic  is  that  sensitive  . 	0.125
Even  while  driving  they  could  hear 	0.0001
when  I  shifted  gears  . 	0.0001
Not  that  it  's  obtrusive  to  the  other  person  on  the  phone  , 	0.4583333333333333
it  's  just  good  to  be  aware 	0.125
they  can  hear  it  all  . 	0.0001
What  more  to  say  about  such  a  simple  device  . 	0.375
Form  Fit  and  Function  are  all  there  and  I  would  recommend  this  product  . 	0.25
In  fact  , 	0.0001
I  just  ordered  another  - 	0.0001
it  makes  a  great  gift 	0.0001
I  have  been  using  a  Chemex  10-cup  coffee  maker  for  several  weeks  and  have  never  had  such  good  coffee  before  in  my  life  . 	0.375
I  am  constantly  looking  forward  to  my  next  pot  of  coffee  ! 	0.1875
There  is  a  downside  to  this  coffee  maker  : 	0.125
it  is  a  more  manual  procedure  than  what  you  are  used  to  , 	0.125
and  it  also  takes  a  couple  of  pots 	0.125
to  learn 	0.0001
how  to  use  this  most  efficiently  . 	0.0001
The  first  time  I  tried  to  use  mine  , 	0.0001
I  had  ground  my  coffee  way  too  finely  and  it  just  took  forever  ! 	0.25
The  big  time  consumers  : 	0.125
you  have  to  boil  your  water  separately 	0.0001
-LRB-  you  do  have  a  water  kettle  right  ?  -RRB- 	0.0001
and  then  you  have  to  gradually  pour  the  boiled  water  through  the  Chemex  . 	0.0001
This  means  that  while  the  coffee  is  brewing  , 	0.125
you  are  pouring  ,  or  watching  ,  or  giving  the  filter  area  a  bit  of  a  stir  . 	0.125
Now  the  up  side  : 	0.0001
you  will  never  ever  ever  drink  a  better  cup  of  coffee  . 	0.625
I  use  filtered  water  ,  freshly  ground  home  roasted  beans  ,  and  this  Chemex  to  produce  the  finest  coffee 	0.0001
I  have  ever  had  the  pleasure  of  drinking  . 	0.0001
And  this  coffee  is  a  pleasure  ! 	0.125
In  fact  , 	0.0001
I  `  ve  totally  given  up  using  cream  and  sugar 	0.125
because  my  coffee  no  longer  has  anything  to  hide  . 	0.125
Another  up  side  : 	0.0001
clean  up  means 	0.375
swishing  the  Chemex  with  warm  water 	0.0001
and  tossing  the  water  down  the  drain  . 	0.0001
You  can  also  wash  with  a  bottle  brush 	0.125
but  this  is  rarely  necessary  . 	0.125
A  brief  swish  is  really  all 	0.125
it  takes  to  get  your  Chemex 	0.0001
looking  factory  new  . 	0.0001
Try  that  with  your  electric  drip  machine  ! 	0.0001
Ha  !  That  thing  will  NEVER  look  brand  new  ! 	0.625
Oh  ,  here  's  a  final  upside  : 	0.0001
this  Chemex  brews  the  best  coffee 	0.0001
you  `  ll  ever  drink  , 	0.0001
and  it  costs  less  than  just  about  anything  . 	0.5
You  are  probably  already  spending  more  money  than  this  every  month  at  Starbucks  ! 	0.125
Go  ahead 	0.0001
and  buy  yourself  one  of  these  . 	0.0001
If  necessary  ,  wake  up  10  minutes  earlier  to  make  your  coffee  . 	0.0001
Better  yet  ,  wake  up  20  minutes  earlier  . 	0.0001
And 	0.0001
when  your  coffee  is  ready  ,  instead  of  dumping  it  into  a  travel  cup 	0.125
and  bolting  out  the  door  ,  sit  down 	0.125
and  enjoy  your  first  cup  for  the  next  10  minutes  . 	0.0001
You  deserve  it  ! 	0.125
UPDATE  : 	0.0001
It  's  been  a  year  now 	0.125
and  I  still  love  this  Chemex  . 	0.125
However  ,  over  time  the  glass  acquired  a  coffee  color  tinge 	0.5
that  gradually  became  darker  with  each  use  . 	0.0001
Nothing  I  tried  got  it  clean  , 	0.3125
but  something  my  wife  tried  did  : 	0.0001
a  splash  of  bleach  in  otherwise  clean  water 	0.0001
followed  by  a  thorough  swishing  . 	0.0001
Now  my  Chemex 	0.0001
looks  brand  new 	0.0001

One  day  later  ? 	0.0001

That  's  how  bad  it  was  . 	0.375

-LRB-  great  option  -  costs  LG  money  , 	0.25

The  rebate  requires  me  to  buy  another  LG  or  Goldstar  product  . 	0.25

so  you  do  n't  need  bamboo  leaves  , 	0.25
but  having  a  bamboo  plant  around  the  house  would  n't  hurt  . 	0.375
The  book  is  especially  helpful  , 	0.125

While  browsing  at  the  store 	0.0001
I  noticed  that  the  ones 	0.0001

And  so  I  went  to  the  friendly  manager  of  the  store  that  I  was  in  and  he  opened  two  of  the  different  packages  for  me 	0.125
