1_kitchen_neg_1	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_0	Within a few weeks of purchase
1_kitchen_neg_2	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_1	the teflon in the Zojirushi pan started to blister and flake off .
1_kitchen_neg_3	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_2	This is NOT the result of customer abuse but a manufacturing defect .
1_kitchen_neg_4	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_3	This is my third -LRB- and final -RRB-
1_kitchen_neg_5	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_4	bread machine .
1_kitchen_neg_6	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_5	The first two were Breadman Ultimates .
1_kitchen_neg_7	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_6	I should note that I make bread in the machine about 6 times a week on average , pretty much every morning .
1_kitchen_neg_8	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_7	The first Breadman worked for over a year until the teflon in the pan started to fail .
1_kitchen_neg_9	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_8	This was probably my fault for allowing the pan
1_kitchen_neg_10	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_9	to soak for extended periods of time
1_kitchen_neg_11	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_10	-LRB- water can get behind the teflon
1_kitchen_neg_12	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_11	and ruin the bond -RRB- .
1_kitchen_neg_13	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_12	I bought an new Breadman Ultimate
1_kitchen_neg_14	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_13	because the entire machine was only slightly more than the pan alone and the old machine was starting to have mechanical problems .
1_kitchen_neg_15	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_14	This time I took extremely good care of the pan
1_kitchen_neg_16	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_15	-LRB- letting it cool down , no soaking -RRB-
1_kitchen_neg_17	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_16	because it 's clearly the weak link in the system .
1_kitchen_neg_18	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_17	Within 8 months the stirring shaft that drives the paddle in the pan simply fell out .
1_kitchen_neg_19	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_18	Whatever the detente mechanism was that holds the shaft to the pan failed ,
1_kitchen_neg_20	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_19	making the machine useless .
1_kitchen_neg_21	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_20	Currently it does n't seem very easy
1_kitchen_neg_22	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_21	-LRB- or even possible -RRB-
1_kitchen_neg_23	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_22	to buy a replacement pan for the Breadman .
1_kitchen_neg_24	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_23	At this point I was done with the Breadman .
1_kitchen_neg_25	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_24	Much as I did n't want to spring for the extra money for the Zojirushi ,
1_kitchen_neg_26	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_25	and realizing
1_kitchen_neg_27	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_26	that my default augmented
1_kitchen_neg_28	positive	False	1_kitchen_neg_27	sourdough recipe probably would n't work the same in the new machine ,
1_kitchen_neg_29	positive	False	1_kitchen_neg_28	I did n't see an alternative
1_kitchen_neg_30	positive	False	1_kitchen_neg_29	and got one .
1_kitchen_neg_31	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_30	Within 3 weeks the teflon in the Zoji pan formed two blisters .
1_kitchen_neg_32	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_31	One is bit
1_kitchen_neg_33	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_32	smaller than a dime and all the teflon at this spot has flaked off ;
1_kitchen_neg_34	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_33	the other spot is blistering
1_kitchen_neg_35	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_34	but the teflon is still intact .
1_kitchen_neg_36	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_35	I have been extremely careful with the pan :
1_kitchen_neg_37	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_36	I wait
1_kitchen_neg_38	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_37	for it to cool and then remove the baked-on bread under the paddles with warm water using mostly my fingers .
1_kitchen_neg_39	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_38	I do n't let it soak at all .
1_kitchen_neg_40	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_39	This is clearly a manufacturing defect .
1_kitchen_neg_41	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_40	I have further complaints with respect to this machine as compared to the Breadman Ultimate :
1_kitchen_neg_42	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_41	1 -RRB- The top of the bread rarely gets brown .
1_kitchen_neg_43	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_42	I ` ve added more sugar to the recipe
1_kitchen_neg_44	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_43	which helps slightly
1_kitchen_neg_45	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_44	but not much .
1_kitchen_neg_46	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_45	2 -RRB- I do n't understand what the crust control option does .
1_kitchen_neg_47	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_46	It does n't seem to increase baking time
1_kitchen_neg_48	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_47	which it does on the Breadman so it does n't make much sense .
1_kitchen_neg_49	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_48	3 -RRB- The programmability is very weak .
1_kitchen_neg_50	positive	False	1_kitchen_neg_49	On the Breadman
1_kitchen_neg_51	positive	False	1_kitchen_neg_50	you can take any of the existing standard options
1_kitchen_neg_52	positive	False	1_kitchen_neg_51	and modify them as well as make up entirely new programs .
1_kitchen_neg_53	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_52	4 -RRB- The programmability options are very limited :
1_kitchen_neg_54	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_53	- You ca n't control the knockdown time between risings .
1_kitchen_neg_55	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_54	- You ca n't add risings to the default three .
1_kitchen_neg_56	positive	False	1_kitchen_neg_55	They do give you a lot of time control on the risings .
1_kitchen_neg_57	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_56	- You ca n't separate the mixing cycle from the kneading cycle :
1_kitchen_neg_58	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_57	it 's all one cycle .
1_kitchen_neg_59	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_58	-
1_kitchen_neg_60	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_59	When you turn off the preheat cycle ,
1_kitchen_neg_61	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_60	this only affects the built-in programs and not the custom ones .
1_kitchen_neg_62	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_61	- And worst of all :
1_kitchen_neg_63	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_62	you
1_kitchen_neg_64	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_63	ca n't bake for more than 70 minutes .
1_kitchen_neg_65	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_64	This is utterly ridiculous .
1_kitchen_neg_66	positive	False	1_kitchen_neg_65	"I 'm sure this is a "" safety feature """
1_kitchen_neg_67	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_66	but it means
1_kitchen_neg_68	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_67	you ca n't correct for the pathetic lack of crust formation or have larger recipes
1_kitchen_neg_69	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_68	and so forth .
1_kitchen_neg_70	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_69	This is almost a killer limitation in my opinion .
1_kitchen_neg_71	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_70	For those other reviewers
1_kitchen_neg_72	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_71	that are having issues with rising ,
1_kitchen_neg_73	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_72	I ` ve determined
1_kitchen_neg_74	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_73	that the machine is very sensitive to the amount , type , and quality of yeast .
1_kitchen_neg_75	positive	False	1_kitchen_neg_74	If you \* exactly \* follow the manufacturers instuctions with respect
1_kitchen_neg_76	positive	False	1_kitchen_neg_75	to yeast and use fresh yeast ,
1_kitchen_neg_77	positive	False	1_kitchen_neg_76	it should work okay .
1_kitchen_neg_78	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_77	This means you must use rapid rise yeast with the Quick programs
1_kitchen_neg_79	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_78	and active dry yeast with the longer standard programs .
1_kitchen_neg_80	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_79	Even using Fleischmann 's instead of Red Star made a difference .
1_kitchen_neg_81	positive	False	1_kitchen_neg_80	The Breadman was pretty much indifferent to yeast variations .
1_kitchen_neg_82	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_81	At this point I 'm
1_kitchen_neg_83	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_82	done with bread machines .
1_kitchen_neg_84	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_83	They are a failed technology .
1_kitchen_neg_85	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_84	In fact , teflon is a dangerous and substandard technology .
1_kitchen_neg_86	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_85	All you have to do is search for teflon
1_kitchen_neg_87	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_86	-LRB- Polytetrafluoroethylene -RRB-
1_kitchen_neg_88	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_87	and toxic to come up with some pretty alarming data on this noxious substance .
1_kitchen_neg_89	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_88	The manufacturing process results in significant environmental contamination .
1_kitchen_neg_90	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_89	A direct consumer health risk due to toxic outgassing occurs
1_kitchen_neg_91	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_90	when teflon is exposed to temperatures above 500 degrees
1_kitchen_neg_92	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_91	-LRB- eg :
1_kitchen_neg_93	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_92	frying pans -RRB- .
1_kitchen_neg_94	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_93	Perhaps bread machines are not that risky
1_kitchen_neg_95	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_94	given the lower temps
1_kitchen_neg_96	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_95	involved in baking and the fact
1_kitchen_neg_97	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_96	that wet dough will keep the average pan temperature pretty low , but if you know anything about toxicity
1_kitchen_neg_98	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_97	you will realize that it is always a sliding scale :
1_kitchen_neg_99	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_98	there will be some outgassing at lower temperatures .
1_kitchen_neg_100	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_99	Imagine low levels of toxic gas
1_kitchen_neg_101	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_100	released into your homemade bread .
1_kitchen_neg_102	negative	True	1_kitchen_neg_101	I ` ve thought about this ,
1_kitchen_neg_103	negative	True	1_kitchen_neg_102	but there 's no way to make a bread machine without teflon --
1_kitchen_neg_104	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_103	going from mixing dough to baking requires teflon ,
1_kitchen_neg_105	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_104	there is just no other viable solution .
1_kitchen_neg_106	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_105	I love
1_kitchen_neg_107	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_106	making bread every day
1_kitchen_neg_108	negative	True	1_kitchen_neg_107	and I 'm going to miss this activity
1_kitchen_neg_109	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_108	but at this point the manufacturing defects and use of teflon mean
1_kitchen_neg_110	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_109	I have to give up on this technology .
1_kitchen_neg_111	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_110	It 's back to the occasional hand-made loaf --
1_kitchen_neg_112	negative	False	1_kitchen_neg_111	it 's the only rational and healthy solution
