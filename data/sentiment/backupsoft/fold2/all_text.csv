15_cell_pos_1	My  previous  phone  was  the  Motorola  V60i  with  a  monochrome  screen  with  Cingular  ,  so  I  am  still  getting 
15_cell_pos_2	used  to  all  the  differences  in  phone  capabilities 
15_cell_pos_3	and  have  barely  scratched  the  surface  of  what  the  i560  can  do  . 
15_cell_pos_4	Here  's  a  breakdown  of  the  pros  and  cons  so  far 
15_cell_pos_5	-LRB-  after  a  week  -RRB-  . 
15_cell_pos_6	PROS 
15_cell_pos_7	-LRB-  in  order  of  coolness  ,  best  first  -RRB-  : 
15_cell_pos_8	1  .  Nextel  's  Direct  Connect  is  amazingly  fast  and  their  network  very  clear  . 
15_cell_pos_9	2  .  Any  call  ,  either  DirectConnect  or  regular  call  can  be  made  with  the  flip  open  or  closed  . 
15_cell_pos_10	You  can  scroll  through  recent  calls  with  the  flip  closed  and  call  any  of  them  . 
15_cell_pos_11	3  .  If  you  `  re  concerned  about  radio 
15_cell_pos_12	-LRB-  RF  -RRB-  radiation 
15_cell_pos_13	-  and  you  should  be  even  though  nobody  talks  about  it  anymore  ,  this  phone  has  the  extendable  antenna 
15_cell_pos_14	to  get  the  transmission  point  further  away  from  you 
15_cell_pos_15	-LRB-  and  improves  the  transmission  -RRB-  . 
15_cell_pos_16	4  .  The  speakerphone  is  as  loud 
15_cell_pos_17	as  you  need  it  to  be  , 
15_cell_pos_18	even  at  dinning  room  table  with  the  TV  on  and  the  sound 
15_cell_pos_19	patched  through  the  stereo  system 
15_cell_pos_20	-LRB-  very  impressive  -RRB-  . 
15_cell_pos_21	There  is  virtually  no  lag  in  the  switch  between  listening  and  speaking  using  the  speakerphone 
15_cell_pos_22	-LRB-  full  duplex  -RRB-  . 
15_cell_pos_23	You  can  also  turn  its  volume  down 
15_cell_pos_24	to  a  whisper  if  you  want  to  . 
15_cell_pos_25	5  . 
15_cell_pos_26	The  phone  is  a  little  wider  than  some  phones 
15_cell_pos_27	-LRB-  like  the  V60  -RRB-  , 
15_cell_pos_28	but  is  very  light  . 
15_cell_pos_29	Yet  the  phone  meets  the  tough  Military  specs  . 
15_cell_pos_30	6  .  Rubberized  grips  on  the  phone  make  it  easy  to  grip 
15_cell_pos_31	and  dial  with  one  hand 
15_cell_pos_32	and  phone  has  a  comfortable  feel  in  my  medium-sized  hand  . 
15_cell_pos_33	Phone  has  slight  hourglass 
15_cell_pos_34	shape 
15_cell_pos_35	-LRB-  wider  at  the  bottom  -RRB- 
15_cell_pos_36	to  fit  nicely  into  the  hand  . 
15_cell_pos_37	7  . 
15_cell_pos_38	Charger  charges  the  battery  FAST  .  .  . 
15_cell_pos_39	MUCH  faster  than  my  V60  ever  charged  . 
15_cell_pos_40	8  .  Phone  has  all  the  standard  stuff 
15_cell_pos_41	I  love  and  could  n't  live  without  : 
15_cell_pos_42	voice  dialing  ,  custom  rings  for  calls  from  my  contact  list  ,  handsfree  ,  long  recent  calls  list 
15_cell_pos_43	-LRB-  up  to  20  -RRB-  ,  ability  to  store  number 
15_cell_pos_44	to  Contacts  from  recent  calls 
15_cell_pos_45	-LRB-  without  having  to  key  the  number  , 
15_cell_pos_46	just  have  to  enter  the  name  -RRB-  . 
15_cell_pos_47	CONS 
15_cell_pos_48	-LRB-  in  order  of  annoyance  ,  worst  first  -RRB-  : 
15_cell_pos_49	1  .  The  phone  is  almost  completely  made  of  plastic  ,  and  I  `  ve  never  thought  plastic  was  as  durable  as  metal  . 
15_cell_pos_50	While  Motorola  makes  truly  awesome  phones  , 
15_cell_pos_51	I  worry  there  might  be  an  over-reliance  on  plastic  to  protect  the  insides  of  the  phone  . 
15_cell_pos_52	2  . 
15_cell_pos_53	When  the  phone  is  in  the  holster  ,  the  outside  display  is  not  visible  , 
15_cell_pos_54	forcing 
15_cell_pos_55	me  to  remove  the  phone  from  the  holster 
15_cell_pos_56	to  see 
15_cell_pos_57	who  's  calling  -LRB-  for  those 
15_cell_pos_58	that  do  n't  have  a  custom  ring 
15_cell_pos_59	configured  -RRB- 
15_cell_pos_60	or  to  check  the  time  . 
15_cell_pos_61	Very  annoying  , 
15_cell_pos_62	as  I  'm  used  to  using  my  phone  as  a  watch  . 
15_cell_pos_63	3  .  The  icons  on  the  outside  display  are  small 
15_cell_pos_64	and  those  who  are  overdue  for  a  new  eye  prescription  might  have  trouble 
15_cell_pos_65	seeing  and  interpreting  the  icons  . 
15_cell_pos_66	The  only  two  parts 
15_cell_pos_67	that  are  clear  : 
15_cell_pos_68	the  battery 
15_cell_pos_69	-LRB-  important  -RRB- 
15_cell_pos_70	and  date\/time  . 
15_cell_pos_71	4  .  The  flimsy  port  cover  at  bottom  of  the  phone 
15_cell_pos_72	-LRB- 
15_cell_pos_73	where  you  connect  the  charger  ,  etc  -RRB-  make 
15_cell_pos_74	me  think 
15_cell_pos_75	that  someday  I  'm  going  to  look  down 
15_cell_pos_76	there 
15_cell_pos_77	and  find  it  missing  . 
15_cell_pos_78	It  's  easy  enough 
15_cell_pos_79	to  pop  off  , 
15_cell_pos_80	"but  sometimes  takes  ""  persuading  "" "
15_cell_pos_81	to  put  back 
15_cell_pos_82	and  have  it  cover  the  slot  completely 
15_cell_pos_83	-LRB- 
15_cell_pos_84	because  it  needs  to  be  a  snug  fit 
15_cell_pos_85	to  meet  the  military  spec  -RRB-  . 
15_cell_pos_86	OVERALL  , 
15_cell_pos_87	I  really  like  the  phone 
15_cell_pos_88	and  highly  recommend  it  to  all 
8_kitchen_pos_1	I  have  the  black  Fusion  in  my  home  office 
8_kitchen_pos_2	-LRB- 
8_kitchen_pos_3	which  is  next  to  a  basement-level  theater  room  -RRB-  , 
8_kitchen_pos_4	and  my  wife 
8_kitchen_pos_5	and  I  already  love  this  machine  . 
8_kitchen_pos_6	We  have  tried  all  sorts  of  mixes  ,  and  we  `  ve  only  scratched  the  surface  of  what  this  machine  can  do  . 
8_kitchen_pos_7	This  is  one  of  the  first  times 
8_kitchen_pos_8	I  `  ve  been  so  impressed  with  a  product  that  I  wanted  to  write  a  review  for  it  . 
8_kitchen_pos_9	Physical  properties  : 
8_kitchen_pos_10	It  handles  travel  mugs 
8_kitchen_pos_11	-LRB-  if  you  remove  the  drip  tray  , 
8_kitchen_pos_12	which  is  largely  unneeded  anyway  -RRB-  , 
8_kitchen_pos_13	"and  all  our  ""  standard  ""  mugs  . "
8_kitchen_pos_14	The  drink  head  moves  up  and  down  ,  so  it  can  sit  flush  against  the  rim  of  your  mug 
8_kitchen_pos_15	to  cut  down  on  the  already  rare  splashbacks 
8_kitchen_pos_16	"-LRB-  more  common  with  ""  frothy  "" "
8_kitchen_pos_17	drinks  than  coffee  and  tea  -RRB-  . 
8_kitchen_pos_18	When  it  brews  a  filterpack  , 
8_kitchen_pos_19	it  blows  air  through  at  the  end  of  the  cycle 
8_kitchen_pos_20	to  clear  it  out 
8_kitchen_pos_21	-LRB-  and  ,  thus  ,  keep  it  from  dripping 
8_kitchen_pos_22	as  you  remove  it  -RRB-  . 
8_kitchen_pos_23	The  water  tank  could  be  larger 
8_kitchen_pos_24	-LRB-  if  only  because  we  `  re  so  enamored  with  it  that  we  keep 
8_kitchen_pos_25	making  drinks  all  day  long  -RRB-  , 
8_kitchen_pos_26	but  if  you  have  a  ready  source  of  water  nearby  , 
8_kitchen_pos_27	it  should  n't  be  a  problem  . 
8_kitchen_pos_28	The  tank  fits  better 
8_kitchen_pos_29	and  slides  on  easier  than  the  Senseo 
8_kitchen_pos_30	-LRB- 
8_kitchen_pos_31	which  we  also  have  -RRB-  . 
8_kitchen_pos_32	Flavor-wise  : 
8_kitchen_pos_33	It  's  made  by  M&M  \/  Mars  ,  so 
8_kitchen_pos_34	you  can  bet  that  the  sweeter  drinks 
8_kitchen_pos_35	-LRB-  the  so-called  Indulgence  fare  -RRB-  is  excellent  . 
8_kitchen_pos_36	"Coffee  blends  are  quite  good  ,  especially  the  darker  roasts  like  ""  French  Roast  "" "
8_kitchen_pos_37	"and  ""  Sumatra  ""  . "
8_kitchen_pos_38	Lattes  made  with  Espresso  Roast  taste  similar  to  Starbucks  ,  moreso  than  other  chains  . 
8_kitchen_pos_39	Clean-up  : 
8_kitchen_pos_40	Wipe  the  inside  of  the  drink  head  ,  and  possibly  the  front  of  the  plastic  column 
8_kitchen_pos_41	-LRB-  the  colored  portion  -RRB- 
8_kitchen_pos_42	"after  any  particularly  ""  splashy  "" "
8_kitchen_pos_43	drinks  . 
8_kitchen_pos_44	No  need 
8_kitchen_pos_45	to  worry  about  cleaning  up  the  area  around  the  machine  ,  especially  if  you  keep  the  drink  head  on  the  rim  of  your  mug  . 
8_kitchen_pos_46	Of  course  , 
8_kitchen_pos_47	you  ca  n't  watch  its  magic 
8_kitchen_pos_48	when  the  drink  head  is  that  low  , 
8_kitchen_pos_49	so  your  first  few  times  , 
8_kitchen_pos_50	you  `  ll  probably  get  a  drip  here 
8_kitchen_pos_51	and  there  . 
8_kitchen_pos_52	Final  bits  : 
8_kitchen_pos_53	We  `  ve  had  the  Senseo  since  its  launch  . 
8_kitchen_pos_54	Between  pods 
8_kitchen_pos_55	"that  need  ""  pre-wetting  "" "
8_kitchen_pos_56	to  avoid 
8_kitchen_pos_57	blowing  past  the  seal  of  the  portafilter  to  the  not-so-great  varieties  of  drinks  , 
8_kitchen_pos_58	the  Senseo  is  lagging  behind  the  Flavia  . 
8_kitchen_pos_59	"We  drink  coffee  ,  tea  ,  espresso  drinks  ,  mixed  blends  ,  and  sweet-tooth-friendly  ""  indulgence  ""  mixes  every  day  with  the  Flavia  , "
8_kitchen_pos_60	and  it  's  brain-dead-easy  to  use  . 
8_kitchen_pos_61	Certainly  easier  to  clean  up  after  ,  too  ! 
8_kitchen_pos_62	If  you  `  re  on  the  fence  between  the  Flavia  and  other  single-cup  offerings 
8_kitchen_pos_63	-LRB-  like  Senseo  -RRB-  , 
8_kitchen_pos_64	get 
8_kitchen_pos_65	the  Flavia  . 
8_kitchen_pos_66	Keurig  and  other  single-cup  offerings  ca  n't  touch  the  variety  of  drinks 
8_kitchen_pos_67	you  can  make  with  the  Flavia  . 
8_kitchen_pos_68	I  'm  sipping  a  lemon\/blueberry  tea  blend  now  , 
8_kitchen_pos_69	made  over  ice  , 
8_kitchen_pos_70	and  it  's  fantastic  . 
8_kitchen_pos_71	Highly  recommended 
11_kitchen_neg_1	I  own  the  graphite  style  of  this  set  . 
11_kitchen_neg_2	I  was  originally  very  happy  with  the  purchase 
11_kitchen_neg_3	- 
11_kitchen_neg_4	the  set  looked  great  ,  did  n't  chip  easily  ,  and  was  a  great  size  . 
11_kitchen_neg_5	After  a  year  of  use 
11_kitchen_neg_6	I  `  ve  come  up  with  a  list  of  problems  : 
11_kitchen_neg_7	The  clear  glazed  surface  on  the  plates  and  bowls  can  be  scored  by  utensils 
11_kitchen_neg_8	which  allows  water\/dirt  to  penetrate  to  the  porous  ceramic  below  leaving  stains 
11_kitchen_neg_9	that  can  not  be  removed  . 
11_kitchen_neg_10	"The  semi-matte  finish  acquires  a  ""  powdery  ""  ,  almost  bleached  ,  look  to  it  after  many  washings "
11_kitchen_neg_11	-LRB-  says  dishwasher  safe  , 
11_kitchen_neg_12	guess 
11_kitchen_neg_13	that  means  the  colors  do  n't  wash  away  immediately  -RRB- 
11_kitchen_neg_14	My  biggest  complaint  : 
11_kitchen_neg_15	We  bought  these 
11_kitchen_neg_16	"because  they  were  ""  microwave  safe  ""  . "
11_kitchen_neg_17	I  do  n't  know  what  microwave  safe  means  to  most  people  , 
11_kitchen_neg_18	but  it  means  to  me  that  I  could  put  a  plate  ,  bowl  or  cup  in  the  microwave  ,  heat  up  the  contents  , 
11_kitchen_neg_19	and  then  safely  remove  the  object 
11_kitchen_neg_20	and  use  it  . 
11_kitchen_neg_21	In  the  case  of  the  set 
11_kitchen_neg_22	I  purchased  , 
11_kitchen_neg_23	it  only  seems  to  mean 
11_kitchen_neg_24	that  the  item 
11_kitchen_neg_25	placed  in  the  microwave  will  not  explode  . 
11_kitchen_neg_26	Unfortunately  in  the  case  of  the  Sango  Graphite  set  , 
11_kitchen_neg_27	it  means  that  the  contents  of  the  set  are  sheilded  by  the 
11_kitchen_neg_28	-LRB-  plate\/bowl\/cup  -RRB- 
11_kitchen_neg_29	and  that  the  contents  will  emerge  warm 
11_kitchen_neg_30	at  best  while  you  burn  your  hand 
11_kitchen_neg_31	attempting  to  extract  the 
11_kitchen_neg_32	-LRB-  plate\/bowl\/cup  -RRB- 
11_kitchen_neg_33	that  has  soaked  all  of  the  energy  up  from  the  microwave  . 
11_kitchen_neg_34	They  get  VERY  hot  ! 
11_kitchen_neg_35	-LRB-  Cup  of  water 
11_kitchen_neg_36	heated  for  2  mins  results  in  water  temperature  of  120F 
11_kitchen_neg_37	while  cup  surface  is  170F  !  -RRB- 
11_kitchen_neg_38	I  `  ve  only  broken  2  items  from  the  set  ,  both  times 
11_kitchen_neg_39	I  dropped  the  items  after  getting  them  partly  out  of  the  microwave 
11_kitchen_neg_40	and  realizing 
11_kitchen_neg_41	that  my  fingers  were  being  burned 
11_kitchen_neg_42	-LRB-  first  time  I  thought 
11_kitchen_neg_43	it  was  a  fluke  ,  second  time 
11_kitchen_neg_44	I  learned  my  lesson  -RRB- 
11_kitchen_neg_45	and  dropped  the  item  on  the  hard  stove  surface  below  the  microwave  . 
11_kitchen_neg_46	I  emailed  Sango  several  times 
11_kitchen_neg_47	and  received  no  response  at  all  . 
11_kitchen_neg_48	While  I  liked  the  set  a  lot  initially  , 
11_kitchen_neg_49	I  have  been  very  disappointed  over  time  with  its  quality  . 
11_kitchen_neg_50	I  will  never  purchase  another  from  Sango  again 
18_gourmet_pos_1	I  `  ve  been  ruling  Adab  ,  the  biggest  little  city-state  in  Sumeria  ,  for  almost  .  .  . 
18_gourmet_pos_2	Has  it  been  70  years  ? 
18_gourmet_pos_3	Wow  , 
18_gourmet_pos_4	it  just  seems  like  yesterday  Mesh-Ki-Ang-Nanna  was  vanquished 
18_gourmet_pos_5	and  the  kingship  was  taken  from  Urim  . 
18_gourmet_pos_6	LOL  . 
18_gourmet_pos_7	Anyways  ,  due  to  my  hectic  schedule  of  riding  through  the  streets  , 
18_gourmet_pos_8	standing  atop  my  jeweled  chariot 
18_gourmet_pos_9	pulled  by  a  team  of  grunting  oxen  on  my  way 
18_gourmet_pos_10	to  the  ziggurat  , 
18_gourmet_pos_11	I  barely  have  time  to  be  fed  anymore  . 
18_gourmet_pos_12	It  's  not  as  if  I  can  be  expected  to  munch  on  a  wieldy  leg  of  lamb  during  my  morning  full  body  shave  . 
18_gourmet_pos_13	But  then  one  day  a  traveler  who  I  had  commanded  to  bring  back  the  finest  exoticities  from  the  farthest  ends  of  our  flat  disc  ,  came  to  me  with  a  handful  of  small  round  pellets  . 
18_gourmet_pos_14	"He  called  them  ""  California  Red  Seedless  Grapes  ""  . "
18_gourmet_pos_15	I  had  him  immediately  put  to  death  for  reciting  words 
18_gourmet_pos_16	I  had  never  heard  before  , 
18_gourmet_pos_17	but  I  was  intrigued  . 
18_gourmet_pos_18	And  would  n't  you  know  it  , 
18_gourmet_pos_19	but  during  my  afternoon  copulation  with  two  dozen  virgins  ,  these  grapes  were  exactly  what  I  needed  . 
18_gourmet_pos_20	I  was  able  to  do  my  usual  defiling 
18_gourmet_pos_21	of  whomever 
18_gourmet_pos_22	I  choosed  and  yet  due  to  the  curious  vine  these  pellets  hung  upon  ,  never 
18_gourmet_pos_23	once  was  I  unable  to  calm  my  disgustingly  bloated  belly  . 
18_gourmet_pos_24	And  did  I  mention  the  taste  ? 
18_gourmet_pos_25	IMHO  , 
18_gourmet_pos_26	It  's  like  a  glorious  gift  from  Enlil  that  both  An  and  Ki  have  given  their  blessing  to  ,  with  the  bonus  of  no  seeds  . 
18_gourmet_pos_27	I  mean  seriously  ,  our  Gods  are  truly  seers  of  all  to  know 
18_gourmet_pos_28	that  I  'm  no  fan  of  seeds  . 
18_gourmet_pos_29	But  in  conclusion 
18_gourmet_pos_30	while  I  still  do  n't  know 
18_gourmet_pos_31	"where  this  ""  California  "" "
18_gourmet_pos_32	is  , 
18_gourmet_pos_33	I  know 
18_gourmet_pos_34	that  they  have  a  wonderful  fruit  , 
18_gourmet_pos_35	and  I  hope  that  soon  we  conquer  them  . 
18_gourmet_pos_36	I  also  hope  they  have  virgins  . 
18_gourmet_pos_37	Also  since  I  'm  already  here  , 
18_gourmet_pos_38	you  guys  heard  the  one  about  the  three  ox-drivers  from  Adab  ? 
18_gourmet_pos_39	You  know  , 
18_gourmet_pos_40	"where  the  punchline  is  ""  With  elaborate  words  ,  with  elaborate  words  ,  the  case  of  the  citizens  of  Adab  was  settled  . "
18_gourmet_pos_41	Pa-nijin-jara  , 
18_gourmet_pos_42	"their  sage  ,  the  scholar  ,  the  god  of  Adab  ,  was  the  scribe  .  ""  ? "
18_gourmet_pos_43	LMAO  , 
18_gourmet_pos_44	that  gets  me  every  time 
8_gourmet_neg_1	We  were  happy  with  the  gift  baskets 
8_gourmet_neg_2	that  were  delivered  . 
8_gourmet_neg_3	However  the  company  only  has  one  distribution  center  in  California  , 
8_gourmet_neg_4	which  is  obviously  not  efficient  to  deliver  to  the  East  Coast  . 
8_gourmet_neg_5	Despite  the  company  's  ambitions 
8_gourmet_neg_6	to  become  a  national  company  , 
8_gourmet_neg_7	they  are  not  willing  to  pony  up  the  money  to  get  additional  distribution  facilities  outside  of  California  . 
8_gourmet_neg_8	This  maybe  great  if  you  live  in  California  . 
8_gourmet_neg_9	However  I  live  in  Florida 
8_gourmet_neg_10	and  I  ordered  on  December  22 
8_gourmet_neg_11	and  my  basket  did  not  arrive  until  January  4th  . 
8_gourmet_neg_12	I  think 
8_gourmet_neg_13	that  would  be  unacceptable  in  anyone  's  view  , 
8_gourmet_neg_14	espescially  since  giving  a  gift  basket  can  be  time-sensitive  . 
8_gourmet_neg_15	Until  this  company  gets  with  the  program 
8_gourmet_neg_16	and  gets  other  distribution  facilities  I  would  stay  away 
8_gourmet_neg_17	unless  you  want  to  wait  two  weeks  for  a  simple  basket  to  be  delivered  . 
2_cell_neg_1	First  ,  let 
2_cell_neg_2	me  say 
2_cell_neg_3	that  I  really  wanted  to  like  this  device  . 
2_cell_neg_4	I  had  patience  and  understanding  for  a  while 
2_cell_neg_5	but  it  got  me  nowhere  . 
2_cell_neg_6	The  main  issue  with  this  phone  is  its  operating  system  : 
2_cell_neg_7	Windows  Mobile  5.0  . 
2_cell_neg_8	This  OS  is  a  piece  of  fluff  garbage  . 
2_cell_neg_9	Simple  things  that  should  take  a  click  or  two  have  become  so  difficult 
2_cell_neg_10	to  access  that  you  basically  just  give  up  . 
2_cell_neg_11	Main  Gripes 
2_cell_neg_12	----------- 
2_cell_neg_13	Connectivity  with  T-Mobile  is  horrible  : 
2_cell_neg_14	accessing  the  aim  function  does  n't  work  9  times  out  of  10  . 
2_cell_neg_15	E-mail  functions  are  useless  . 
2_cell_neg_16	I  tried 
2_cell_neg_17	finding  a  solution  for  hours  and  the  best  I  got  was  having  my  email 
2_cell_neg_18	checked  every  hour 
2_cell_neg_19	but  deleted  shortly  after  that  . 
2_cell_neg_20	Internet  explorer  can  NEVER  find  the  page  that  I  'm  looking  for  and  consistently  tells  me  to  try  again  . 
2_cell_neg_21	Even  when  connected  to  wi-fi  this  happens  . 
2_cell_neg_22	Let  me  tell  you  also  that  this  device  does  not  let  you  choose  between  wi-fi  and  edge  . 
2_cell_neg_23	If  you  already  opened  IE  and  you  were  using  EDGE  then  it  will  continue  to  use  EDGE 
2_cell_neg_24	unless  you  restart  the  phone  with  wi-fi  enabled  . 
2_cell_neg_25	Calls 
2_cell_neg_26	----- 
2_cell_neg_27	Making  a  call  was  so  difficult  that  I  wanted  to  smash  the  phone  on  a  daily  basis  . 
2_cell_neg_28	Usually  , 
2_cell_neg_29	I  would  press  talk 
2_cell_neg_30	to  dial  a  call 
2_cell_neg_31	"and  it  would  immediately  say  ""  Call  Ended  .  "" "
2_cell_neg_32	It  's  as  if  the  device  does  n't  even  want  to  try  . 
2_cell_neg_33	Also  , 
2_cell_neg_34	when  answering  a  call  ,  well  trying  to  answer  a  call  , 
2_cell_neg_35	it  would  drop  it  as  soon  as  I  pressed  talk  . 
2_cell_neg_36	What  the  HELL  is  THAT  !  ? 
2_cell_neg_37	What  good  is  a  phone 
2_cell_neg_38	if  you  ca  n't  make  or  receive  calls  ? 
2_cell_neg_39	Keep  in  mind  this  happens  around  half  the  time  . 
2_cell_neg_40	Also  keep  in  mind  that  I  live  in  NEW  YORK  CITY  ! 
2_cell_neg_41	My  calls  should  not  be  dropping  except  for  when  I  'm  in  the  subway  . 
2_cell_neg_42	The  side  volume  button  is  extremely  annoying  causing  the  volume 
2_cell_neg_43	to  go  to  both  extremes  within  one  conversation  . 
2_cell_neg_44	Not  only  that  , 
2_cell_neg_45	but  when  you  disable  it  , 
2_cell_neg_46	you  have  no  other  method  of  changing  the  volume  on  the  device  . 
2_cell_neg_47	ARGGGHHH  ! 
2_cell_neg_48	Keyboard 
2_cell_neg_49	------- 
2_cell_neg_50	While  the  keyboard  is  basically  easy  to  type  on  ,  the  phone  is  buggy  . 
2_cell_neg_51	First  off  ,  the  t9  sucks  ! 
2_cell_neg_52	It  will  completely  change  the  word 
2_cell_neg_53	you  are  typing  to  a  word 
2_cell_neg_54	that  's  in  its  dictionary 
2_cell_neg_55	while  you  `  re  typing  ! 
2_cell_neg_56	EXTREMELY  FRUSTRATING  ! 
2_cell_neg_57	Now  get  this  , 
2_cell_neg_58	you  ca  n't  even  permanently  keep  the  t9  off  . 
2_cell_neg_59	So  you  have  to  keep  going  into  the  menu 
2_cell_neg_60	to  change  it  to  normal  ABC  mode  . 
2_cell_neg_61	While  I  appreciate  the  ability  to  have  faster  typing  ,  is  n't  the  whole  point  of  a  QWERTY 
2_cell_neg_62	being  able  to  type  without  using  t9  ? 
2_cell_neg_63	"When  you  actually  get  to  typing  ,  sometimes  ,  the  keys  will  ""  stick  "" "
2_cell_neg_64	and  a  character  will  continuously  repeat  until  you  stop  it  . 
2_cell_neg_65	This  is  n't  a  physical  keyboard  issue  but  yet  another  software  issue  . 
2_cell_neg_66	Programs 
2_cell_neg_67	------- 
2_cell_neg_68	For  all 
2_cell_neg_69	you  techno  oriented  people  out  there 
2_cell_neg_70	-LRB-  basically  everyone  buying  this  phone  -RRB-  , 
2_cell_neg_71	the  programs  this  device  has  available  for  download  are  minuscule  . 
2_cell_neg_72	Not  only  is  the  catalog  of  programs  extremely  limited 
2_cell_neg_73	but  when  using  a  JAVA  program 
2_cell_neg_74	-LRB- 
2_cell_neg_75	which  most  programs  are  coded  in  -RRB- 
2_cell_neg_76	the  Dash  's  JAVA  program  will  not  allow 
2_cell_neg_77	you 
2_cell_neg_78	to  open  those  programs  . 
2_cell_neg_79	I  ALWAYS  get  an  error 
2_cell_neg_80	"stating  ""  A  Java  midlet  is  not  responding  "" "
2_cell_neg_81	It  then  gives  me  the  choice  of  waiting  or  killing  the  app  . 
2_cell_neg_82	Neither  of  which  solve 
2_cell_neg_83	anything  . 
2_cell_neg_84	This  phone  is  so  useless 
2_cell_neg_85	it  's  beyond  words  . 
2_cell_neg_86	I  could  go  on  and  on  about  it  's  issues 
2_cell_neg_87	but  I  really  do  n't  care  to  . 
2_cell_neg_88	STAY  AWAY  FROM  THIS  PHONE  ! 
2_cell_neg_89	While  T-mobile  customer  support  is  very  helpful  and  friendly  , 
2_cell_neg_90	their  service\/coverage  is  non-existent  . 
2_cell_neg_91	Calls  are  constantly  dropped  , 
2_cell_neg_92	I  get  voice  mails 
2_cell_neg_93	without  the  phone  even  ringing  , 
2_cell_neg_94	and  internet  connectivity  is  never  really  available  . 
2_cell_neg_95	Please  ,  do  yourself  a  favor 
2_cell_neg_96	and  wait  for  the  iPhone  . 
11_cell_pos_1	I  purchased  this  Nokia  5300  Black  at  the  T-Mobile  store  . 
11_cell_pos_2	It  does  come  with  1  GB  memory  card 
11_cell_pos_3	and  I  was  able  to  easily  load  up  160  songs  last  night  with  no  problems  . 
11_cell_pos_4	Phone  comes  with  USB  cable  to  connect  to  your  computer  . 
11_cell_pos_5	I  have  a  Mac 
11_cell_pos_6	so  this  was  easy  to  do  . 
11_cell_pos_7	You  will  not  be  able  to  download  songs 
11_cell_pos_8	bought  from  iTunes 
11_cell_pos_9	but  you  can  load  up  AAC  files  and  mp3  and  mp4  . 
11_cell_pos_10	You  can  hold  up  to  500  songs  if  they  are  all  3.5  minutes  long  and  compressed  to  128  kps  . 
11_cell_pos_11	My  music  is  usually  remixed  and\/or  longer  than  3.5  minutes  each  . 
11_cell_pos_12	I  was  n't  able  to  sync  up  with  Bluetooth  to  my  iBook 
11_cell_pos_13	but  I  was  able  to  pair  with  my  Motorola  T305  that  I  will  be  using  in  my  car  . 
11_cell_pos_14	Apple  has  not  approved  the  Nokia  5300  yet  to  sync  . 
11_cell_pos_15	I  am  sure 
11_cell_pos_16	it  is  a  matter  of  time  since  the  phone  is  rather  new  . 
11_cell_pos_17	Overall  , 
11_cell_pos_18	I  love  the  feel  of  this  phone  ,  has  wonderful  2  in  screen  ,  color  is  great  ,  camera  is  cool  , 
11_cell_pos_19	and  it  is  very  intuitive  to  use  . 
11_cell_pos_20	I  have  been  with  Samsung  over  the  last  three  years 
11_cell_pos_21	and  I  was  concerned  about  going  back  to  a  Nokia  . 
11_cell_pos_22	However  ,  the  speakerphone  is  absolutely  great  compared  to  the  Motorola  195  that  I  originally  got  but  returned  . 
11_cell_pos_23	Once  you  load  up  your  songs  , 
11_cell_pos_24	the  speaker  is  impressive  . 
11_cell_pos_25	This  morning  , 
11_cell_pos_26	I  had  the  phone  playing  music  in  one  part  of  the  house  , 
11_cell_pos_27	and  I  had  to  go  get  something  at  the  other  end  of  the  house  , 
11_cell_pos_28	and  I  could  still  hear  the  music  perfectly  . 
11_cell_pos_29	Calling  on  the  phone  was  better  than  expected  . 
11_cell_pos_30	I  was  talking  to  my  friend  during  busy  traffic  and  lots  of  people\/background  noise 
11_cell_pos_31	and  I  was  able  to  carry  on  a  pleasant  conversation  with  her  unlike  my  Samsung 
11_cell_pos_32	that  was  difficult  to  do  this  with  . 
11_cell_pos_33	The  phone  is  quite  sturdy  . 
11_cell_pos_34	And  I  am  happy  to  have  a  phone 
11_cell_pos_35	that  not  everyone  has  -  a  Motorola  Razor  . 
11_cell_pos_36	This  Nokia  5300  looks  a  bit  chucky  compared  to  that  phone 
11_cell_pos_37	but  I  feel  like  I  have  a  very  unique  phone 
11_cell_pos_38	that  is  more  than  a  phone  . 
11_cell_pos_39	Who  needs  an  iPod  mini 
11_cell_pos_40	when  you  can  get  this  and  your  phone  all  in  one  ? 
11_cell_pos_41	I  just  ordered  the  Boxwave  Frost  Case  for  this  phone  . 
11_cell_pos_42	There  is  very  little  to  chose  from  at  the  T-Mobile  store 
11_cell_pos_43	as  far  as  accessories  and  Nokia.com  did  n't  have  much  either  . 
11_cell_pos_44	\*\*\*\*\* 
11_cell_pos_45	The  alarm  feature  to  wake  up  is  cool  too  . 
11_cell_pos_46	You  can  choose  to  wake  up  to  your  favorite  song  that  you  have  downloaded  and  you  can  program  it  to  slowly  increase  the  volume  of  the  song  for  your  alarm  . 
11_cell_pos_47	It  also  comes  with  programmable  snooze  . 
11_cell_pos_48	What  a  dream  ! 
11_cell_pos_49	\*\*\*\*\* 
11_cell_pos_50	You  can  make  calls 
11_cell_pos_51	without  even  having  to  slide  the  phone 
11_cell_pos_52	to  dial  . 
11_cell_pos_53	As  long  as  you  have  the  number 
11_cell_pos_54	you  want  already  stored  in  your  phone  book  , 
11_cell_pos_55	then  all  you  have  to  do  is  look  up 
11_cell_pos_56	and  press  the  green  button  ! 
11_cell_pos_57	\*\*\*\*\* 
11_cell_pos_58	When  you  are  playing  your  music  , 
11_cell_pos_59	if  an  incoming  call  comes  in  , 
11_cell_pos_60	it  will  stop  playing  the  song 
11_cell_pos_61	and  then  alert  you  with  the  normal  ring  tone  that  a  call  is  coming  in  . 
11_cell_pos_62	Once  you  are  done  with  the  phone  call  , 
11_cell_pos_63	you  can  resume  playing  your  music  . 
11_cell_pos_64	\*\*\*\*\* 
11_cell_pos_65	As  I  said  ,  this  phone  is  a  gem  in  all  areas 
11_cell_pos_66	-  speaker  ,  sturdy  ,  colorful  , 
11_cell_pos_67	I  think 
11_cell_pos_68	it  is  contemporary 
11_cell_pos_69	and  an  acquired  taste  for  sure  but  nonetheless  appealing  ,  call  quality  is  great  even  in  loud  areas  ,  and  lots  of  little  creature  comforts  . 
11_cell_pos_70	Definitely  consider  this  phone  if  you  really  like  to  have  music 
11_cell_pos_71	and  bluetooth  and  speakerphone  . 
11_cell_pos_72	Else  ,  this  may  not  be  the  phone  for  you 
14_kitchen_pos_1	This  is  a  lovely  little  crockpot 
14_kitchen_pos_2	whose  small  size  makes  it  uniquely  useful  for  a  number  of  purposes  . 
14_kitchen_pos_3	I  `  ve  owned  larger  crockpots  for  a  couple  decades 
14_kitchen_pos_4	-LRB-  currently  a  6  quart  Rival  Smartcooker  is  my  mainstay  for  preparing  family-size  meals  -RRB-  , 
14_kitchen_pos_5	but  the  larger  pots  take  up  a  significant  amount  of  counter  space  &  are  n't  at  all  useful  for  heating  or  re-heating  small  quantities  . 
14_kitchen_pos_6	This  little  crockpot  ,  however  ,  is  perfect  for  heating  or  re-heating  2-4  servings  of  soup  or  stew  . 
14_kitchen_pos_7	I  originally  bought  it  ,  however  , 
14_kitchen_pos_8	because  it  is  \*  absolutely  perfect  \*  for  making  hot  cereal  on  cold  mornings  ,  especially  those  hot  cereals 
14_kitchen_pos_9	that  require  more  than  a  few  minutes  of  cooking  in  the  microwave  or  on  the  stovetop  ,  such  as  steel-cut  oatmeal 
14_kitchen_pos_10	-LRB-  try  the  nutty  goodness  of  traditional  steel-cut  oatmeal 
14_kitchen_pos_11	once  -LRB-  also  available  here  at  Amazon  -RRB- 
14_kitchen_pos_12	"&  you  `  re  unlikely  ever  to  return  to  instant  or  ""  quick  cook  ""  oatmeal  again  -RRB-  . "
14_kitchen_pos_13	There  is  nothing  nicer  on  a  cold  winter  morning  than  walking  into  the  kitchen  &  knowing  that  a  healthy  ,  delicious  hot  breakfast  is  awaiting  you  . 
14_kitchen_pos_14	From  mid-October  to  late-March  ,  virtually  every  night  I  prepare  my  entire  family  's  hot  breakfast  cereal  for  the  next  morning  in  this  little  crockpot  ,  with  no  more  effort 
14_kitchen_pos_15	than  is  required  to  make  single  serving  of  instant  oatmeal  or  cream  of  wheat  in  the  microwave  . 
14_kitchen_pos_16	Other  uses 
14_kitchen_pos_17	we  `  ve  discovered  : 
14_kitchen_pos_18	it  's  perfect  for  making  &  serving  hot  mulled  cider  ; 
14_kitchen_pos_19	keeping  hot  dips  , 
14_kitchen_pos_20	gravies  &  warm  sauces  &  syrups 
14_kitchen_pos_21	heated  on  the  buffet  ; 
14_kitchen_pos_22	as  a  substitute  fondue  pot  ; 
14_kitchen_pos_23	&  for  heating  soup  at  times 
14_kitchen_pos_24	when  hovering  over  a  stovetop  or  near  a  microwave  would  be  incovenient 
14_kitchen_pos_25	-LRB-  how  nice  to  come  inside  from  raking  leaves  or  shoveling  snow  to  a  hot  bowl  of  soup  !  -RRB-  . 
14_kitchen_pos_26	For  single  people  or  couples 
14_kitchen_pos_27	who  prefer  not  to  cook  in  large  quantities  or  apartment  dwellers  with  limited  storage  space  ,  this  crockpot  would  be  a  very  acceptable  slow  cooker  , 
14_kitchen_pos_28	especially  if  used  in  conjunction  with  Rival  's  inexpensive  SP100-PDQ  Smart-Part  Module 
14_kitchen_pos_29	-LRB-  also  sold  on  Amazon  as  of  the  date  of  this  review  -RRB-  , 
14_kitchen_pos_30	which  provides  the  same  timed-cooking  controls 
14_kitchen_pos_31	that  are  integrated  with  many  of  Rival  's  larger  ,  more  expensive  crockpots  . 
14_kitchen_pos_32	The  energy  used  is  minimal  ,  too 
14_kitchen_pos_33	--  only  80  watts  -- 
14_kitchen_pos_34	&  the  stoneware  bowl  fits  easily  in  the  dishwasher  , 
14_kitchen_pos_35	as  does  the  lid  ,  for  very  convenient  clean-up 
16_kitchen_neg_1	Okay  , 
16_kitchen_neg_2	I  bought  for  the  price  . 
16_kitchen_neg_3	And  it  is  effective  enough  . 
16_kitchen_neg_4	But  it  is  very  clumsy  and  unergonomic  , 
16_kitchen_neg_5	so  that  after  a  couple  minutes  of  use 
16_kitchen_neg_6	it  is  difficult  to  handle  any  longer  . 
16_kitchen_neg_7	The  main  problems  are  : 
16_kitchen_neg_8	Balance  of  weight  ,  and  the  switch  . 
16_kitchen_neg_9	First  ,  the  switch  : 
16_kitchen_neg_10	Because  it  is  a  cheap  push-in  button  , 
16_kitchen_neg_11	which  must  be  constantly  depressed  to  keep  the  knife  on  , 
16_kitchen_neg_12	you  lose  optimum  control  quickly  . 
16_kitchen_neg_13	The  handle  is  badly  placed  for  this  , 
16_kitchen_neg_14	as  your  thumb  must  always  be  on  TOP  of  the  handle  and  forward  toward  the  front  of  it  , 
16_kitchen_neg_15	but  you  ca  n't  hold  your  hand  up  there 
16_kitchen_neg_16	because  your  wrist  angle  will  be  completely  wrong  for  cutting  . 
16_kitchen_neg_17	In  addition  , 
16_kitchen_neg_18	keeping 
16_kitchen_neg_19	that  button  depressed  is  difficult 
16_kitchen_neg_20	not  only  because  it  does  require  a  constant  application  of  pressure 
16_kitchen_neg_21	at  a  different  direction  from  both  the  grasp 
16_kitchen_neg_22	and  the  application  of  the  knife  ,  but  because  the  button  sinks  deep  into  the  handle  ,  so  your  thumb  is  inside  the  handle  as  you  `  re  trying  to  hold  and  control  the  knife  : 
16_kitchen_neg_23	Quick  cramp  . 
16_kitchen_neg_24	Moreover  , 
16_kitchen_neg_25	as  you  `  re  pushing  it  in  , 
16_kitchen_neg_26	if  the  food  you  `  re  cutting  is  moist 
16_kitchen_neg_27	-LRB-  like  a  turkey  -RRB-  , 
16_kitchen_neg_28	juices  may  run  onto  the  handle  ,  your  thumb  --  and  into  the  hole  into  which  you  `  re  pressing  the  button  . 
16_kitchen_neg_29	NOT  safe  . 
16_kitchen_neg_30	A  couple  times  I  `  ve  wondered  whether  that  shooting  pain  in  my  thumb  was  from  nerve  torture  or  electric  shock  ; 
16_kitchen_neg_31	either  way  , 
16_kitchen_neg_32	it  was  n't  good  . 
16_kitchen_neg_33	Then  the  weight  distribution  of  the  knife  is  not  very  good  . 
16_kitchen_neg_34	Look  at  the  huge  bulk  of  the  motor  -- 
16_kitchen_neg_35	and  then  look  at  where  the  handle  is  located  ,  and  how  it  is  designed  . 
16_kitchen_neg_36	There  's  no  way  to  hold  this  at  a  proper  angle  with  the  handle 
16_kitchen_neg_37	shaped  as  it  is  . 
16_kitchen_neg_38	Add  in  the  need  to  be  depressing  the  power  button 
16_kitchen_neg_39	as  you  `  re  holding  it  awkwardly  ,  and  .  .  . 
16_kitchen_neg_40	2  stars  for  effectiveness  ; 
16_kitchen_neg_41	minus  3  for  bad  functional  design 
8_gourmet_pos_1	Red  Bull  used  to  be  my  favorite  drink  , 
8_gourmet_pos_2	as  I  would  not  go  24  hours  without  drinking  an  entire  can  . 
8_gourmet_pos_3	That  era  has  ended  simply 
8_gourmet_pos_4	because  I  was  beginning  to  get  sick  of  paying  over  $  2.00  for  one  can  . 
8_gourmet_pos_5	I  know  several  distributors 
8_gourmet_pos_6	who  offer  the  product  for  $  1.50  , 
8_gourmet_pos_7	but  I  seldomly  stock  up  on  the  stuff 
8_gourmet_pos_8	and  end  up 
8_gourmet_pos_9	paying  the  $  2.00  for  a  can  plus  8  %  tax  , 
8_gourmet_pos_10	which  comes  out  to  $  2.15  a  can  . 
8_gourmet_pos_11	Which  is  fine 
8_gourmet_pos_12	with  me  until  you  realize 
8_gourmet_pos_13	that  you  are  spending  over  700  dollars  a  year  at  this  rate  . 
8_gourmet_pos_14	It  never  stopped  me  before 
8_gourmet_pos_15	and  I  always  felt 
8_gourmet_pos_16	that  it  was  worth  it  , 
8_gourmet_pos_17	considering 
8_gourmet_pos_18	the  drink  helps  me  focus  in  college  each  morning  . 
8_gourmet_pos_19	However  , 
8_gourmet_pos_20	I  recently  noticed  that  on  days 
8_gourmet_pos_21	when  I  was  not  in  school  and  I  drank  a  Red  Bull  , 
8_gourmet_pos_22	rather  than  being  full  of  energy 
8_gourmet_pos_23	and  ready  to  jog  , 
8_gourmet_pos_24	I  would  become  tired  . 
8_gourmet_pos_25	I  began  to  wonder 
8_gourmet_pos_26	why  I  would  get  tired  after  drinking  a  can  of  Red  Bull  . 
8_gourmet_pos_27	Maybe  my  inner  body  was  saying  , 
8_gourmet_pos_28	"stop  drinking  this  \*\*\*\*  every  freaking  day  of  your  life  !  "" "
8_gourmet_pos_29	Whatever  the  case  is  , 
8_gourmet_pos_30	I  decided  to  stop  buying  it  on  a  daily  basis 
8_gourmet_pos_31	and  just  drink  it 
8_gourmet_pos_32	when  I  have  to  wake  up  very  early  . 
8_gourmet_pos_33	Hopefully  this  can  make 
8_gourmet_pos_34	it  become  effective  on  my  body  again  , 
8_gourmet_pos_35	because  I  think 
8_gourmet_pos_36	I  may  have  overdone 
8_gourmet_pos_37	it  , 
8_gourmet_pos_38	considering 
8_gourmet_pos_39	I  have  probably  consumed  well  over  1000  cans  in  my  life  . 
8_gourmet_pos_40	I  personally  enjoy  drinking  a  cold  can  of  Red  Bull  . 
8_gourmet_pos_41	Set  aside  the  energy  factor  . 
8_gourmet_pos_42	While  many  people 
8_gourmet_pos_43	-LRB-  actually  everyone  I  know  -RRB- 
8_gourmet_pos_44	says 
8_gourmet_pos_45	it  is  sick 
8_gourmet_pos_46	and  makes  them  gag  , 
8_gourmet_pos_47	I  kinda  like  that  cough  droppy  taste 
8_gourmet_pos_48	that  is  offered  in  a  can  of  Red  Bull  . 
8_gourmet_pos_49	I  find  Red  Bull  to  be  a  conversation  starter  for  myself  -  kinda  like  smoker  talk  . 
8_gourmet_pos_50	I  love  to  sip  from  my  can  of  Red  Bull 
8_gourmet_pos_51	and  discuss  the  weather  or  some  other  exciting  news  with  my  peers  . 
8_gourmet_pos_52	While  I  have  tried  so  many  other  energy  drinks  , 
8_gourmet_pos_53	I  can  say 
8_gourmet_pos_54	that  I  do  hate  all  of  them  . 
8_gourmet_pos_55	There  has  never  been  an  energy  drink 
8_gourmet_pos_56	that  I  enjoyed  other  than  Red  Bull  . 
8_gourmet_pos_57	I  guess  I  just  like  the  Austrian  people  so  much 
8_gourmet_pos_58	-LRB-  and  the  fact 
8_gourmet_pos_59	that  a  can  of  Red  Bull  is  vegan  !  -RRB- 
8_gourmet_pos_60	On  the  other  hand  , 
8_gourmet_pos_61	it  is  full  of  man-made  chemicals 
8_gourmet_pos_62	that  might  do  some  weird  things  to  me  in  the  future  -  only  time  will  tell 
20_gourmet_neg_1	I  thought  my  Fresh  Vine  Ripe  Tomatoes  would  come  whole  . 
20_gourmet_neg_2	Instead  , 
20_gourmet_neg_3	as  you  can  see  from  the  graphic  , 
20_gourmet_neg_4	I  received  five  whole  tomatoes  and  one 
20_gourmet_neg_5	that  had  already  been  cut  in  half  . 
20_gourmet_neg_6	Yes  ,  half  a  tomato  . 
20_gourmet_neg_7	The  half-tomato  in  my  package  had  dripped  on  the  other  ones 
20_gourmet_neg_8	and  made  quite  a  mess  . 
20_gourmet_neg_9	In  fact  ,  the  resulting  tomato  juice  ate  a  hole  through  the  box 
20_gourmet_neg_10	they  arrived  in  , 
20_gourmet_neg_11	making  a  puddle  on  the  floor 
20_gourmet_neg_12	that  was  small  , 
20_gourmet_neg_13	but  big  enough 
20_gourmet_neg_14	to  trip  the  UPS  guy  . 
20_gourmet_neg_15	He  fell  and  fractured  his  spine  , 
20_gourmet_neg_16	and  now  he  's  paralyzed  . 
20_gourmet_neg_17	His  wife  and  nine  children  are  destitute  ,  all  thanks  to  these  vine-ripened  tomatoes  . 
20_gourmet_neg_18	In  conclusion  , 
20_gourmet_neg_19	I  think 
20_gourmet_neg_20	this  packaging  is  just  a  bad  idea
