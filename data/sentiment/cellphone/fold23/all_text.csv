3_cell_neg_1	I ` ve used the Palm OS going on 10 years now .
3_cell_neg_2	When my Treo 270 died ,
3_cell_neg_3	I bought a used 270 on Ebay .
3_cell_neg_4	Eventually that one died too
3_cell_neg_5	and I bought an unlocked 650 on Amazon .
3_cell_neg_6	"I called Palm "" tech support """
3_cell_neg_7	on issues
3_cell_neg_8	I had with it
3_cell_neg_9	-LRB- dial up networking
3_cell_neg_10	did n't work on internal browser with T-Mobile -RRB- .
3_cell_neg_11	Forgive me for saying it ,
3_cell_neg_12	but the guy at Palm support was as dumb as dumb can be .
3_cell_neg_13	I got someone
3_cell_neg_14	overseas
3_cell_neg_15	who told
3_cell_neg_16	me one inaccurate thing
3_cell_neg_17	after another -LRB- he insisted
3_cell_neg_18	that my Treo 270 never allowed dial up networking with the internal browser -
3_cell_neg_19	even though I told him first hand
3_cell_neg_20	that I used it all the time - did
3_cell_neg_21	he think
3_cell_neg_22	I was lying to him ? -RRB- .
3_cell_neg_23	He knew nothing
3_cell_neg_24	about the phone
3_cell_neg_25	and kept deferring to a supervisor , constantly keeping me on hold
3_cell_neg_26	and it was just a huge waste of time .
3_cell_neg_27	After a few calls like this with no resolution
3_cell_neg_28	I gave up
3_cell_neg_29	and decided to return the 650 .
3_cell_neg_30	I then tried the T-Mobile MDA .
3_cell_neg_31	I was uneasy of the idea of switching to Windows PocketPC
3_cell_neg_32	but decided to give it a try .
3_cell_neg_33	For me
3_cell_neg_34	it was a huge mistake - Pocket PC is a joke and completely unintuitive .
3_cell_neg_35	They expect you to study
3_cell_neg_36	how to use their OS
3_cell_neg_37	in order to make use of its clumsy interface .
3_cell_neg_38	Friends tell me they sell 3rd party applications
3_cell_neg_39	that make
3_cell_neg_40	it easier
3_cell_neg_41	to use , but c'mon -
3_cell_neg_42	when you buy a phone
3_cell_neg_43	you expect it to work right from the beginning -
3_cell_neg_44	I do n't want to have to spend time learning and installing additional software for it to work properly .
3_cell_neg_45	Finally ,
3_cell_neg_46	I give up on Pocket PC
3_cell_neg_47	-LRB- sold it on Ebay -RRB-
3_cell_neg_48	and give Palm another try
3_cell_neg_49	when I see the 680 come out .
3_cell_neg_50	The dialup
3_cell_neg_51	networking issue is no longer a problem on the 680
3_cell_neg_52	-LRB-
3_cell_neg_53	as compared to the 650 -RRB-
3_cell_neg_54	and
3_cell_neg_55	I buy
3_cell_neg_56	it unlocked directly from Palm .
3_cell_neg_57	Overall ,
3_cell_neg_58	it 's a decent phone
3_cell_neg_59	and I just feel way more comfortable with Palm OS over Pocket PC .
3_cell_neg_60	Palm customer support is still useless and ,
3_cell_neg_61	as others have mentioned ,
3_cell_neg_62	the lack of a standard Mini-USB connector is simply inexcusable .
3_cell_neg_63	Still ,
3_cell_neg_64	I 'm much happier with Palm-OS over Pocket PC .
3_cell_neg_65	As I use it ,
3_cell_neg_66	I see that the battery does n't seem to last very long
3_cell_neg_67	-LRB- just over 2 hours of talktime at the most -RRB- .
3_cell_neg_68	I hesitantly call
3_cell_neg_69	Palm support and get some flunkie again -
3_cell_neg_70	"I decide to cut my losses and stop wasting my time with their "" support "" ."
3_cell_neg_71	I 'm just going to buy a second battery and second charger to keep the phone
3_cell_neg_72	charged .
3_cell_neg_73	I hate the idea of making such a compromise ,
3_cell_neg_74	but for me
3_cell_neg_75	it 's the lesser of two evils .
3_cell_neg_76	The fact that Palm would release a phone with such terrible battery life is indicative of their customer mindset .
3_cell_neg_77	They just do n't care .
3_cell_neg_78	As clunky as my Windows MDA was , its battery life was at least 3 to 4 times
3_cell_neg_79	what the Treo gives me
3_cell_neg_80	-LRB- even though the MDA has a much bigger screen -RRB- .
3_cell_neg_81	IMHO the Smartphone market is still going through growing pains -
3_cell_neg_82	The original Handspring Treo was designed by good people ,
3_cell_neg_83	when Palm bought them out they cashed in on the Treo product line
3_cell_neg_84	but the customer oriented mentality of Handspring went right out the window - along with any intelligent design evolution of the Treo .
3_cell_neg_85	Most of the better designed smartphones on the market
3_cell_neg_86	-LRB- Samsung , Motorola , HTC Wizard -RRB-
3_cell_neg_87	are all
3_cell_neg_88	made for Pocket PC
3_cell_neg_89	because Microsoft has used it 's clout
3_cell_neg_90	to take over the market .
3_cell_neg_91	I just wish other manufacturers offered Palm-OS based smartphones again - this way
3_cell_neg_92	you 'd get the intuitive interface of Palm ,
3_cell_neg_93	without having to be limited to Palm 's poorly designed hardware .
3_cell_neg_94	. . . maybe it 's time I finally give the Blackberry a try . . . :
