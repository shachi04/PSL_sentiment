8_kitchen_pos_1	I have the black Fusion in my home office
8_kitchen_pos_2	-LRB-
8_kitchen_pos_3	which is next to a basement-level theater room -RRB- ,
8_kitchen_pos_4	and my wife
8_kitchen_pos_5	and I already love this machine .
8_kitchen_pos_6	We have tried all sorts of mixes , and we ` ve only scratched the surface of what this machine can do .
8_kitchen_pos_7	This is one of the first times
8_kitchen_pos_8	I ` ve been so impressed with a product that I wanted to write a review for it .
8_kitchen_pos_9	Physical properties :
8_kitchen_pos_10	It handles travel mugs
8_kitchen_pos_11	-LRB- if you remove the drip tray ,
8_kitchen_pos_12	which is largely unneeded anyway -RRB- ,
8_kitchen_pos_13	"and all our "" standard "" mugs ."
8_kitchen_pos_14	The drink head moves up and down , so it can sit flush against the rim of your mug
8_kitchen_pos_15	to cut down on the already rare splashbacks
8_kitchen_pos_16	"-LRB- more common with "" frothy """
8_kitchen_pos_17	drinks than coffee and tea -RRB- .
8_kitchen_pos_18	When it brews a filterpack ,
8_kitchen_pos_19	it blows air through at the end of the cycle
8_kitchen_pos_20	to clear it out
8_kitchen_pos_21	-LRB- and , thus , keep it from dripping
8_kitchen_pos_22	as you remove it -RRB- .
8_kitchen_pos_23	The water tank could be larger
8_kitchen_pos_24	-LRB- if only because we ` re so enamored with it that we keep
8_kitchen_pos_25	making drinks all day long -RRB- ,
8_kitchen_pos_26	but if you have a ready source of water nearby ,
8_kitchen_pos_27	it should n't be a problem .
8_kitchen_pos_28	The tank fits better
8_kitchen_pos_29	and slides on easier than the Senseo
8_kitchen_pos_30	-LRB-
8_kitchen_pos_31	which we also have -RRB- .
8_kitchen_pos_32	Flavor-wise :
8_kitchen_pos_33	It 's made by M&M \/ Mars , so
8_kitchen_pos_34	you can bet that the sweeter drinks
8_kitchen_pos_35	-LRB- the so-called Indulgence fare -RRB- is excellent .
8_kitchen_pos_36	"Coffee blends are quite good , especially the darker roasts like "" French Roast """
8_kitchen_pos_37	"and "" Sumatra "" ."
8_kitchen_pos_38	Lattes made with Espresso Roast taste similar to Starbucks , moreso than other chains .
8_kitchen_pos_39	Clean-up :
8_kitchen_pos_40	Wipe the inside of the drink head , and possibly the front of the plastic column
8_kitchen_pos_41	-LRB- the colored portion -RRB-
8_kitchen_pos_42	"after any particularly "" splashy """
8_kitchen_pos_43	drinks .
8_kitchen_pos_44	No need
8_kitchen_pos_45	to worry about cleaning up the area around the machine , especially if you keep the drink head on the rim of your mug .
8_kitchen_pos_46	Of course ,
8_kitchen_pos_47	you ca n't watch its magic
8_kitchen_pos_48	when the drink head is that low ,
8_kitchen_pos_49	so your first few times ,
8_kitchen_pos_50	you ` ll probably get a drip here
8_kitchen_pos_51	and there .
8_kitchen_pos_52	Final bits :
8_kitchen_pos_53	We ` ve had the Senseo since its launch .
8_kitchen_pos_54	Between pods
8_kitchen_pos_55	"that need "" pre-wetting """
8_kitchen_pos_56	to avoid
8_kitchen_pos_57	blowing past the seal of the portafilter to the not-so-great varieties of drinks ,
8_kitchen_pos_58	the Senseo is lagging behind the Flavia .
8_kitchen_pos_59	"We drink coffee , tea , espresso drinks , mixed blends , and sweet-tooth-friendly "" indulgence "" mixes every day with the Flavia ,"
8_kitchen_pos_60	and it 's brain-dead-easy to use .
8_kitchen_pos_61	Certainly easier to clean up after , too !
8_kitchen_pos_62	If you ` re on the fence between the Flavia and other single-cup offerings
8_kitchen_pos_63	-LRB- like Senseo -RRB- ,
8_kitchen_pos_64	get
8_kitchen_pos_65	the Flavia .
8_kitchen_pos_66	Keurig and other single-cup offerings ca n't touch the variety of drinks
8_kitchen_pos_67	you can make with the Flavia .
8_kitchen_pos_68	I 'm sipping a lemon\/blueberry tea blend now ,
8_kitchen_pos_69	made over ice ,
8_kitchen_pos_70	and it 's fantastic .
8_kitchen_pos_71	Highly recommended
