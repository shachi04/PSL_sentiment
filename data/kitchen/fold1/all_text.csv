1_kitchen_pos_1	Apparently 3rd in the hierarchy of 4 models in the new S5 series of Miele vacuum cleaners , the features , price , and accessories are not exactly linear in transition from lower to higher models , nor even across series .
1_kitchen_pos_2	Many of the older series models have more features and a higher price than the newer ones .
1_kitchen_pos_3	They have fancy names like Capricorn , Red Velvet , and Champagne ,
1_kitchen_pos_4	leading to much confusion
1_kitchen_pos_5	and forcing you to compare each one similar to buying a car .
1_kitchen_pos_6	If your browser has tabbed browsing
1_kitchen_pos_7	-LRB- e. g . , Firefox -RRB- ,
1_kitchen_pos_8	the best way to figure out
1_kitchen_pos_9	which model is best for you is to go to Miele 's website
1_kitchen_pos_10	and open a tab for each model
1_kitchen_pos_11	you ` re interested in .
1_kitchen_pos_12	Flip back
1_kitchen_pos_13	and forth to see what text changes .
1_kitchen_pos_14	Callisto is the cheapest no frills model of the newest series
1_kitchen_pos_15	-LRB- newest technology motor ? -RRB-
1_kitchen_pos_16	that still comes with an electronically powered brush
1_kitchen_pos_17	-LRB- the 4th Pisces model is turbo -RRB- .
1_kitchen_pos_18	After 3 months of extensive use :
1_kitchen_pos_19	Pros :
1_kitchen_pos_20	"Agility - The 10 """
1_kitchen_pos_21	wide SEB217-3 electric powerbrush comes standard ,
1_kitchen_pos_22	and one of the reasons
1_kitchen_pos_23	I chose this model .
1_kitchen_pos_24	For me , smaller is better .
1_kitchen_pos_25	"While other vacuums advertise large 13 """
1_kitchen_pos_26	power brushes to cover more area in a single swipe ,
1_kitchen_pos_27	I do n't have much open carpet space .
1_kitchen_pos_28	Coffee tables , chairs , weight benches , and computers , all need
1_kitchen_pos_29	vacuuming around and under .
1_kitchen_pos_30	The powerbrush swivels well to get around corners .
1_kitchen_pos_31	Brush duster - The most commonly used attachment
1_kitchen_pos_32	-LRB- for me -RRB- ,
1_kitchen_pos_33	the brush duster is also small
1_kitchen_pos_34	-LRB- slightly larger in diameter than the hose -RRB-
1_kitchen_pos_35	and the bristles are durable .
1_kitchen_pos_36	It 's angled by default ,
1_kitchen_pos_37	but even this plastic piece swivels to straighten out .
1_kitchen_pos_38	This is not mentioned anywhere ;
1_kitchen_pos_39	you just have to figure this out for yourself .
1_kitchen_pos_40	On low power ,
1_kitchen_pos_41	I was able to vacuum places
1_kitchen_pos_42	that never got vacuumed before , like over the spider web of computer cables and telephone wires .
1_kitchen_pos_43	I even vacuumed the telephone itself
1_kitchen_pos_44	and other dust collecting objects on my desk .
1_kitchen_pos_45	Parquet floor brush - Initially ,
1_kitchen_pos_46	I wondered
1_kitchen_pos_47	why Miele would include this accessory
1_kitchen_pos_48	when the powerbrush was included ,
1_kitchen_pos_49	"but this "" wider brush duster """
1_kitchen_pos_50	actually does a better job on hard tiled floors than the powerbrush .
1_kitchen_pos_51	The powerbrush seems more
1_kitchen_pos_52	designed to churn up stuff from carpets ,
1_kitchen_pos_53	but the paraquet brush gathers and collects dust
1_kitchen_pos_54	stuck to hard surfaces better .
1_kitchen_pos_55	On the negative side ,
1_kitchen_pos_56	you might have to vacuum the brush
1_kitchen_pos_57	itself to unstuck the dust ,
1_kitchen_pos_58	and I wondered
1_kitchen_pos_59	"why they had to inconvenience the horse for "" genuine horse bristles "" ."
1_kitchen_pos_60	There is no permanent storage on the vacuum cleaner for the parquet brush , so you have to figure out
1_kitchen_pos_61	how to ensure the parts do n't get separated for life
1_kitchen_pos_62	-LRB- the powerbrush takes precedence -RRB- .
1_kitchen_pos_63	Cord rewind - The mechanical rewind
1_kitchen_pos_64	sucked in the entire length of cord every single time , something like 15 for 15 times !
1_kitchen_pos_65	-LRB- The manual says
1_kitchen_pos_66	to pull out the entire length of cord before use to help dissipate heat . -RRB-
1_kitchen_pos_67	Cons :
1_kitchen_pos_68	Price - After all ,
1_kitchen_pos_69	it 's just a vacuum cleaner .
1_kitchen_pos_70	There also seems to be price
1_kitchen_pos_71	fixing in the newer S5 series , at least
1_kitchen_pos_72	when I bought this .
1_kitchen_pos_73	Everywhere I checked
1_kitchen_pos_74	-LRB- maybe 10 websites -RRB- ,
1_kitchen_pos_75	the price was exactly $ 799 or $ 799.95 , with the only difference
1_kitchen_pos_76	being no tax and\/or free shipping .
1_kitchen_pos_77	"One website even advertised "" The lowest price"
1_kitchen_pos_78	"allowed ! """
1_kitchen_pos_79	What 's a Diamond Dealer ?
1_kitchen_pos_80	Is this Amway ?
1_kitchen_pos_81	Release buttons - The release buttons on the attachments and hose are counterintuitive ,
1_kitchen_pos_82	being on the part
1_kitchen_pos_83	"that "" comes off "" rather than on the part"
1_kitchen_pos_84	"that "" stays behind "" ."
1_kitchen_pos_85	Therefore ,
1_kitchen_pos_86	you
1_kitchen_pos_87	must squeeze the button with the same hand
1_kitchen_pos_88	you are pulling away with .
1_kitchen_pos_89	The hose extension button is particularly confusing .
1_kitchen_pos_90	It 's an oval shaped rocker button
1_kitchen_pos_91	"that "" rocks "" very little ."
1_kitchen_pos_92	To extend the stainless steel hose ,
1_kitchen_pos_93	you have to remember
1_kitchen_pos_94	which side of the button
1_kitchen_pos_95	-LRB- top or bottom -RRB-
1_kitchen_pos_96	to press .
1_kitchen_pos_97	There is no distinction on which side to press ,
1_kitchen_pos_98	and it 's always a matter
1_kitchen_pos_99	of trial and error as I yank and tug at the hose
1_kitchen_pos_100	while pressing top and bottom of the extension button .
1_kitchen_pos_101	Stiff no swivel hose -
1_kitchen_pos_102	The hose rotates at the top
1_kitchen_pos_103	-LRB- handle area -RRB- ,
1_kitchen_pos_104	but does not swivel at the base
1_kitchen_pos_105	where it connects to the machine .
1_kitchen_pos_106	Instead of disconnecting and reconnecting to get rid of twists ,
1_kitchen_pos_107	I 'd rather pick up the powerhead
1_kitchen_pos_108	and spin it around
1_kitchen_pos_109	to get out the twists .
1_kitchen_pos_110	The flex hose diameter is larger than I 'm used to ,
1_kitchen_pos_111	making the hose stiffer and difficult to store in the same closet
1_kitchen_pos_112	where I used to store my old vacuum cleaner .
1_kitchen_pos_113	Considering the price , an electrical slip ring would have been nice .
1_kitchen_pos_114	Bag full indicator
1_kitchen_pos_115	- The mechanical bag full indicator is actually an indicator of how much the vacuum cleaner is straining to suck .
1_kitchen_pos_116	Put your hand over the end
1_kitchen_pos_117	to block suction
1_kitchen_pos_118	and it will indicate bag full .
1_kitchen_pos_119	Right out of the box on short carpet ,
1_kitchen_pos_120	it indicated bag full on high power .
1_kitchen_pos_121	As I turned the power down ,
1_kitchen_pos_122	it indicated less full sequentially .
1_kitchen_pos_123	You have to read the instructions about using the floor tool with the tool slightly off the floor
1_kitchen_pos_124	to get an accurate reading from the indicator .
1_kitchen_pos_125	Even at that ,
1_kitchen_pos_126	there are caveats about fine dust or pet hair
1_kitchen_pos_127	that can fool the indicator .
1_kitchen_pos_128	Extra stuff ?
1_kitchen_pos_129	- The parquet brush comes attached with a short plastic extension
1_kitchen_pos_130	that was difficult to plug directly into the stainless steel hose
1_kitchen_pos_131	-LRB- button does n't easily click into place -RRB- .
1_kitchen_pos_132	The extension is n't needed to connect the parquet brush , so you have to remove it
1_kitchen_pos_133	and keep track of where you put it .
1_kitchen_pos_134	To this day ,
1_kitchen_pos_135	I still have n't figured out what the extension is for , other than to connect other attachments
1_kitchen_pos_136	that I might buy in the future .
1_kitchen_pos_137	This is yet another piece with no place to store on the vacuum cleaner that I must ensure does not get
1_kitchen_pos_138	separated for life
1_kitchen_pos_139	"-LRB- along with the parquet brush , "" normal "" filter cage , and replacement bags -RRB- ."
1_kitchen_pos_140	Symbol marking - The power symbol markings are not obvious at all , contrary to claims .
1_kitchen_pos_141	"Other than the symbols labels "" Min """
1_kitchen_pos_142	"and "" Max "" , you have to read the instructions to figure out what the other power symbols mean ."
1_kitchen_pos_143	At least the power seems to increase sequentially
1_kitchen_pos_144	as you turn the dial clockwise .
1_kitchen_pos_145	The Quite Mode is # 4 of 6 settings
1_kitchen_pos_146	-LRB- with 6 being the highest -RRB- ,
1_kitchen_pos_147	and is therefore not actually the quietest
1_kitchen_pos_148	"but intended to be the "" normal "" operating mode ."
1_kitchen_pos_149	I think
1_kitchen_pos_150	"most people will consider "" Max "" the default mode ."
1_kitchen_pos_151	Optional filter frame - This model comes with a HEPA filter , so
1_kitchen_pos_152	you do n't need the filter frame
1_kitchen_pos_153	"unless you ` re going to switch to the "" normal "" filters ,"
1_kitchen_pos_154	but brand-new right out of the box
1_kitchen_pos_155	the frame for the normal filters came with a broken cheap plastic handle ,
1_kitchen_pos_156	apparently due to the way
1_kitchen_pos_157	it was shipped with the handle
1_kitchen_pos_158	protruding out the cardboard wrapping .
1_kitchen_pos_159	You do n't even need the handle for the frame
1_kitchen_pos_160	to function properly ,
1_kitchen_pos_161	but for the kind of money I paid , nothing should be broken out of the box .
1_kitchen_pos_162	The vendor that I bought it from -LRB- Best Vacuum -RRB-
1_kitchen_pos_163	replaced
1_kitchen_pos_164	it for free .
1_kitchen_pos_165	So is it worth
1_kitchen_pos_166	$ 800 ?
1_kitchen_pos_167	It does a good job ,
1_kitchen_pos_168	but only time will tell . .
