18_kitchen_pos_1	I had a Pampered Chef sprayer
18_kitchen_pos_2	that I loved ,
18_kitchen_pos_3	but it got clogged and stopped working after 2 or 3 years .
18_kitchen_pos_4	I should have tried harder to find a Pampered Chef rep to buy another one , the Pampered Chef one works better than this one .
18_kitchen_pos_5	However ,
18_kitchen_pos_6	this is not a horrible product .
18_kitchen_pos_7	One drawback compared to the Pampered Chef one is that you ca n't see through this one to see
18_kitchen_pos_8	how high the oil level is .
18_kitchen_pos_9	You want to fill it just a bit higher than halfway ,
18_kitchen_pos_10	and
18_kitchen_pos_11	when it is less than 1\/3 full you need
18_kitchen_pos_12	to fill it back up or it wo n't work as well .
18_kitchen_pos_13	This unit is even more finicky than the Pampered Chef one about the level ,
18_kitchen_pos_14	it almost wo n't spray if the level is too low .
18_kitchen_pos_15	But since you ca n't see through it ,
18_kitchen_pos_16	even holding it up to the light ,
18_kitchen_pos_17	you have to look down in and estimate
18_kitchen_pos_18	how high it is .
18_kitchen_pos_19	The reflective coating inside makes it very hard to see
18_kitchen_pos_20	how high it really is .
18_kitchen_pos_21	You do n't want to fill it all the way up , either .
18_kitchen_pos_22	Then ,
18_kitchen_pos_23	you need
18_kitchen_pos_24	to pump it more
18_kitchen_pos_25	than the Pampered Chef one needed to be pumped .
18_kitchen_pos_26	This one sprays a very fine spray , finer than the Pampered Chef one .
18_kitchen_pos_27	And it sprays quite nicely if you have the correct level of oil in there .
18_kitchen_pos_28	I think
18_kitchen_pos_29	I know
18_kitchen_pos_30	why my old one got clogged .
18_kitchen_pos_31	So I 'm trying something new :
18_kitchen_pos_32	each time I 'm done ,
18_kitchen_pos_33	before I put it away ,
18_kitchen_pos_34	I twist the screw on cap around the nozzle
18_kitchen_pos_35	and release the pressure .
18_kitchen_pos_36	I think
18_kitchen_pos_37	if you leave it pressured up all the time ,
18_kitchen_pos_38	like I did with my old one ,
18_kitchen_pos_39	it damages the nozzle over time .
18_kitchen_pos_40	But time will tell if I 'm right .
18_kitchen_pos_41	Another tip -- do n't fill it with anything but olive oil .
18_kitchen_pos_42	Other oils evaporate
18_kitchen_pos_43	and leave a sticky\/greasy feeling on the outside of the sprayer .
18_kitchen_pos_44	You know
18_kitchen_pos_45	what I mean if you use vegetable oil for stovetop cooking a lot ,
18_kitchen_pos_46	you get that greasy feeling on things that you leave near the stove or that hang over it .
18_kitchen_pos_47	Olive oil does n't do that ,
18_kitchen_pos_48	that 's why I now do n't use anything else on my stovetop
18_kitchen_pos_49	-LRB- except sometimes peanut oil for stir frying -RRB- .
18_kitchen_pos_50	This type of sprayer will work much better if you just use Olive Oil in it , trust me .
18_kitchen_pos_51	But if you have a choice , go find a Pampered Chef rep and by their sprayer .
18_kitchen_pos_52	It 's cheaper and better quality
