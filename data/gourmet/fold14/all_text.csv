14_gourmet_pos_1	I have been using a Chemex 10-cup coffee maker for almost a year
14_gourmet_pos_2	and have never had such good coffee before in my life .
14_gourmet_pos_3	I am constantly looking forward to my next pot of coffee !
14_gourmet_pos_4	There is a downside to this coffee maker :
14_gourmet_pos_5	it is a more manual procedure than what you are used to ,
14_gourmet_pos_6	and it also takes a couple of pots
14_gourmet_pos_7	to learn
14_gourmet_pos_8	how to use this most efficiently .
14_gourmet_pos_9	The first time I tried to use mine ,
14_gourmet_pos_10	I had ground my coffee way too finely and it just took forever !
14_gourmet_pos_11	The big time consumers :
14_gourmet_pos_12	you have to boil your water separately
14_gourmet_pos_13	-LRB- you do have a water kettle right ? -RRB-
14_gourmet_pos_14	and then you have to gradually pour the boiled water through the Chemex .
14_gourmet_pos_15	This means that while the coffee is brewing ,
14_gourmet_pos_16	you are pouring , or watching , or giving the filter area a bit of a stir .
14_gourmet_pos_17	Now the up side :
14_gourmet_pos_18	you will never ever ever drink a better cup of coffee .
14_gourmet_pos_19	I use filtered water , freshly ground home roasted beans , and this Chemex to produce the finest coffee
14_gourmet_pos_20	I have ever had the pleasure of drinking .
14_gourmet_pos_21	And this coffee is a pleasure !
14_gourmet_pos_22	In fact ,
14_gourmet_pos_23	I ` ve totally given up using cream and sugar
14_gourmet_pos_24	because my coffee no longer has anything to hide .
14_gourmet_pos_25	Another up side :
14_gourmet_pos_26	clean up means
14_gourmet_pos_27	swishing the Chemex with warm water
14_gourmet_pos_28	and tossing the water down the drain .
14_gourmet_pos_29	You can also wash with a bottle brush
14_gourmet_pos_30	but this is rarely necessary .
14_gourmet_pos_31	A brief swish is really all
14_gourmet_pos_32	it takes to get your Chemex
14_gourmet_pos_33	looking factory new .
14_gourmet_pos_34	Try that with your electric drip machine !
14_gourmet_pos_35	Ha !
14_gourmet_pos_36	That thing will NEVER look brand new !
14_gourmet_pos_37	Oh , here 's a final upside :
14_gourmet_pos_38	this Chemex brews the best coffee
14_gourmet_pos_39	you ` ll ever drink ,
14_gourmet_pos_40	and it costs less than just about anything .
14_gourmet_pos_41	You are probably already spending more money than this every month at Starbucks !
14_gourmet_pos_42	Go ahead
14_gourmet_pos_43	and buy yourself one of these .
14_gourmet_pos_44	If necessary , wake up 10 minutes earlier to make your coffee .
14_gourmet_pos_45	Better yet , wake up 20 minutes earlier .
14_gourmet_pos_46	And
14_gourmet_pos_47	when your coffee is ready , instead of dumping it into a travel cup
14_gourmet_pos_48	and bolting out the door , sit down
14_gourmet_pos_49	and enjoy your first cup for the next 10 minutes .
14_gourmet_pos_50	You deserve it
