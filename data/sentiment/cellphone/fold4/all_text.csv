4_cell_pos_1	There are many good reviews on 8525 positive features and most are fairly accurate .
4_cell_pos_2	Lots of good features in the 8525 .
4_cell_pos_3	My intent is to document some
4_cell_pos_4	of the shortcomings of the 8525
4_cell_pos_5	and Windows Mobile OS in the hope that MS and HTC will heed and correct in the future .
4_cell_pos_6	I am a business user
4_cell_pos_7	who wanted to combine my HP IPAQ 1945 and my Motorola V550 Cell phone into one device .
4_cell_pos_8	I use a Motorola H700 headset with my old devices and the 8525 .
4_cell_pos_9	My overall assessment is ;
4_cell_pos_10	Replacing my two 3 year
4_cell_pos_11	old devices resulted in me accepting some compromises
4_cell_pos_12	that I do n't think are necessary in terms of functionality and ease of use .
4_cell_pos_13	All the features I describe below were in the earlier Windows Mobile OS
4_cell_pos_14	used by my IPAQ 1945 or my Motorola flip phone .
4_cell_pos_15	If readers find that there is a way to perform any of the deficiencies
4_cell_pos_16	I describe please let me know .
4_cell_pos_17	My suggestions in rough order of priority :
4_cell_pos_18	1 -RRB- Blue tooth headsets .
4_cell_pos_19	Blue tooth audio should always come through the blue tooth headset regardless of the PDA volume setting .
4_cell_pos_20	To hear my voice commands repeated ,
4_cell_pos_21	I have to turn on the annoying sound of the PDA ,
4_cell_pos_22	so when I voice dial via my Blue tooth headset ,
4_cell_pos_23	I can hear my voice commands
4_cell_pos_24	repeated back .
4_cell_pos_25	I am
4_cell_pos_26	referring to the standard voice dial
4_cell_pos_27	that comes with the 8525 .
4_cell_pos_28	One quick solution would be to tie BT headset to the phone volume setting rather than the PDA .
4_cell_pos_29	Even nicer would be an upgrade
4_cell_pos_30	"that allows full audio with the "" VoiceCommand "" software"
4_cell_pos_31	-LRB- this is documented in many other reviews -RRB- .
4_cell_pos_32	Another nice feature of my Motorola cell phone was as soon as the BT was detected the phone volume
4_cell_pos_33	changed from vibrate
4_cell_pos_34	to audio if it was set to vibrate .
4_cell_pos_35	It changed back to the original audio
4_cell_pos_36	setting after turning off the BT headset .
4_cell_pos_37	1a -RRB- If I request voice dial via my blue tooth headset the screen should ALWAYS display the voice dial page .
4_cell_pos_38	"Instead the initial "" Owner Info "" page stays up"
4_cell_pos_39	and you ca n't see the name on the screen unless you reach down
4_cell_pos_40	and tap the screen .
4_cell_pos_41	Not desirable
4_cell_pos_42	when driving .
4_cell_pos_43	If you did n't set the PDA to its annoying noise level you ca n't hear the name
4_cell_pos_44	you requested
4_cell_pos_45	either .
4_cell_pos_46	2 -RRB- Need
4_cell_pos_47	to be able to control the PDA and phone volume independently for Audio , Vibrate or OFF .
4_cell_pos_48	For example need to be able to tie turn up the phone volume while keeping the PDA volume setting on OFF or vibrate .
4_cell_pos_49	3 -RRB- Need
4_cell_pos_50	to be able
4_cell_pos_51	to program how long the display stays on .
4_cell_pos_52	I am constantly groping to find the power button on the side to keep the display on as it turns off
4_cell_pos_53	when I need
4_cell_pos_54	to see something .
4_cell_pos_55	4 -RRB- I would buy a non Bluetooth headset if one was available for long drives
4_cell_pos_56	when my BT headset battery is dead .
4_cell_pos_57	Only solution I see is the 8525 stereo headphones and turning on the speaker
4_cell_pos_58	which is a little noisy for listeners
4_cell_pos_59	while driving on the freeway .
4_cell_pos_60	5 -RRB-
4_cell_pos_61	Provide a built in way to make the PTT and Comm Manager ,
4_cell_pos_62	and IE Quick key buttons programmable .
4_cell_pos_63	I would use them for many other functions ; such as PTT bringing up the volume control
4_cell_pos_64	so I can change it from vibrate to audio to speaker
4_cell_pos_65	-LRB- need to be able to select speaker here see below -RRB- .
4_cell_pos_66	6 -RRB- Give me a way to press an external button to toggle between speaker on
4_cell_pos_67	and off .
4_cell_pos_68	I ca n't easily push the speaker icon with my fingers .
4_cell_pos_69	Suggestion .
4_cell_pos_70	Add a radio button on the volume control
4_cell_pos_71	that allows you to select speaker phone .
4_cell_pos_72	Yes you can select the phone speaker soft button ,
4_cell_pos_73	but often the display has gone blank
4_cell_pos_74	and the keypad is showing .
4_cell_pos_75	Turning speaker on\/off should be easier .
4_cell_pos_76	7 -RRB- Provide option to save email attachments to storage card .
4_cell_pos_77	That was on my IPAQ Windows OS
4_cell_pos_78	and allowed me to capture lots of attachments without running out of memory .
4_cell_pos_79	8 -RRB- Remember
4_cell_pos_80	the Filter
4_cell_pos_81	setting
4_cell_pos_82	I selected for Tasks .
4_cell_pos_83	If I have filtered by a task category
4_cell_pos_84	during that session remember the filter
4_cell_pos_85	I selected .
4_cell_pos_86	Currently I have so many tasks
4_cell_pos_87	there is a 5 second delay to bring them all up
4_cell_pos_88	9 -RRB- Give me a way to turn off have the Internet browser
4_cell_pos_89	Quick Key
4_cell_pos_90	-LRB- or make this button programmable -RRB-
4_cell_pos_91	I
4_cell_pos_92	am always having to close the browser
4_cell_pos_93	because it gets hit\/selected
4_cell_pos_94	10 -RRB- Let
4_cell_pos_95	me Edit\/Paste with one step for notes , word , task notes etc .
4_cell_pos_96	"The IPAQ has "" Edit """
4_cell_pos_97	at the bottom .
4_cell_pos_98	With 8525 OS
4_cell_pos_99	you must select Menu ,
4_cell_pos_100	then Edit ,
4_cell_pos_101	then Copy .
4_cell_pos_102	Keep Edit on the bottom .
4_cell_pos_103	Question :
4_cell_pos_104	is there a key on the keypad to select CNTRL C for copy like what is done on a PC
4_cell_pos_105	-LRB- the letters are underlined in the menu , but I do n't see a CNTRL key on the keypad ?
4_cell_pos_106	11 -RRB- Allow the trackwheel to scroll up
4_cell_pos_107	to the icons on the top
4_cell_pos_108	and then use the nav button to move across the icons
4_cell_pos_109	-LRB- might be the way
4_cell_pos_110	to allow an external way
4_cell_pos_111	to set audio volume -RRB-
4_cell_pos_112	12 -RRB- If I power off the device have it remember my input selection .
4_cell_pos_113	For example
4_cell_pos_114	"I select "" Letter Recognizer "" ."
4_cell_pos_115	But I must reset each time I power 8525 off .
