15_cell_neg_1	I got this phone basically for free ,
15_cell_neg_2	but even taking that into account ,
15_cell_neg_3	I 'm pretty disappointed with the phone .
15_cell_neg_4	This is my first Samsung
15_cell_neg_5	and ,
15_cell_neg_6	I 'm pretty sure , my last one !
15_cell_neg_7	I owned a Nokia before
15_cell_neg_8	and I regret
15_cell_neg_9	"that I "" betrayed """
15_cell_neg_10	it .
15_cell_neg_11	From now I would n't get anything besides Nokia and in the worst case maybe Sony-Ericsson .
15_cell_neg_12	"So here is a short list of those "" little things """
15_cell_neg_13	that make your life , with this phone
15_cell_neg_14	-LRB- and it 's combination with T-Mobile -RRB- ,
15_cell_neg_15	annoying :
15_cell_neg_16	- the keys are not comfortable to use .
15_cell_neg_17	- it 's not really comfortable to open\/close the slider
15_cell_neg_18	and to make
15_cell_neg_19	it easier
15_cell_neg_20	you have to put your thumb on the screen
15_cell_neg_21	which leaves is greasy all the time .
15_cell_neg_22	- putting a comma ,
15_cell_neg_23	while writing a text message , capitalizes the next word -
15_cell_neg_24	what is the logic in that ? !
15_cell_neg_25	-LRB- it annoys me
15_cell_neg_26	because i do use text messages a lot -RRB-
15_cell_neg_27	- you ca n't set the camera shutter to be silent . . .
15_cell_neg_28	- you can only save 1 phone type for each category -
15_cell_neg_29	what if the person has 2 business phones . . .
15_cell_neg_30	- you can not choose the e-mail address of a person from the contact list
15_cell_neg_31	when you want to send a picture message to an e-mail address .
15_cell_neg_32	And there is a lot more of those little illogical things
15_cell_neg_33	that were just not thought through ,
15_cell_neg_34	like it would ` ve been in a Nokia
15_cell_neg_35	-LRB- even in a model 5 years old ! -RRB-
15_cell_neg_36	Oh yeah ,
15_cell_neg_37	"and T-Mobile really "" contributed "" to the "" greatness """
15_cell_neg_38	of this phone ,
15_cell_neg_39	removing some of the features and limiting others , like setting your mp3 as a ringtone
15_cell_neg_40	-LRB- although , there is an easy hack around it :
15_cell_neg_41	just change the extension from . mp3 to .3 gp
