2_kitchen_neg_6	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_5	Right out of the box
2_kitchen_neg_7	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_6	and trying it for the first time I noticed things
2_kitchen_neg_8	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_7	that I did n't like .
2_kitchen_neg_9	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_8	I thought I 'd give it some time though and hoped

2_kitchen_neg_11	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_10	Here is what I found :
2_kitchen_neg_12	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_11	1 . The vacuum is very heavy
2_kitchen_neg_13	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_12	as other reviewers have stated .
2_kitchen_neg_14	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_13	2 . Worse than the vacuum

2_kitchen_neg_16	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_15	the darn thing is really hard to push .
2_kitchen_neg_17	negative	True	2_kitchen_neg_16	Even on hard smooth surfaces
2_kitchen_neg_18	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_17	it 's hard to push .
2_kitchen_neg_19	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_18	I have not figured out yet what the heck would cause it to have so much drag .
2_kitchen_neg_20	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_19	For it to drag on hard surfaces ,
2_kitchen_neg_21	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_20	it must be a design flaw .
2_kitchen_neg_22	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_21	3 . The on\/off power switch is foot
2_kitchen_neg_23	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_22	operated .
2_kitchen_neg_24	positive	False	2_kitchen_neg_23	Not a terrible thing
2_kitchen_neg_25	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_24	but Dirt Devil decided to put the darn thing out of view
2_kitchen_neg_26	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_25	and hidden by the accessory carriage .
2_kitchen_neg_27	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_26	On my first time of vacuuming I accidentally ran over a sock
2_kitchen_neg_28	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_27	and it got caught in the floor brush .
2_kitchen_neg_29	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_28	While the brush belt was smoking I fumbled around for the damn power switch .
2_kitchen_neg_30	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_29	I finally had to reach down
2_kitchen_neg_31	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_30	and press the switch by hand
2_kitchen_neg_32	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_31	because I could n't find it by looking down .
2_kitchen_neg_33	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_32	It must have taking me eight to ten seconds to finally turn the thing off .
2_kitchen_neg_34	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_33	Unfortunately , the damage was done .
2_kitchen_neg_35	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_34	The belt snapped .

2_kitchen_neg_41	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_40	I have had to repeatedly press the switch
2_kitchen_neg_42	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_41	because it would not lock off .
2_kitchen_neg_43	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_42	It takes a firm steady pressure
2_kitchen_neg_44	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_43	to turn it off .
2_kitchen_neg_45	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_44	The fun part of this annoyance is that you think
2_kitchen_neg_46	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_45	you have it turned off
2_kitchen_neg_47	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_46	because the motor starts winding down
2_kitchen_neg_48	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_47	and as soon as you let up on it the motor powers up .
2_kitchen_neg_49	negative	True	2_kitchen_neg_48	Couple that with not being able to really see the darn thing
2_kitchen_neg_50	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_49	it 's a real challenge .
2_kitchen_neg_51	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_50	Maybe Dirt Devil thinks we have eyes on our toes .
2_kitchen_neg_52	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_51	Hey Dirt Devil here is an idea .
2_kitchen_neg_53	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_52	How about putting the on\/off switch on the push handle .
2_kitchen_neg_54	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_53	What a novel idea .
2_kitchen_neg_55	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_54	Doh !
2_kitchen_neg_56	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_55	4 . The vacuum hose that detaches is really unwieldy .
2_kitchen_neg_57	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_56	It has a long plastic handle
2_kitchen_neg_58	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_57	that you hold onto and
2_kitchen_neg_59	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_58	that makes it really difficult to manipulate the hose .
2_kitchen_neg_60	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_59	The main reason being is that the hose it too short .

2_kitchen_neg_62	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_61	It gets
2_kitchen_neg_63	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_62	tiring .
2_kitchen_neg_64	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_63	5 .
2_kitchen_neg_65	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_64	The detachable hose is really hard to re-install in it 's port .
2_kitchen_neg_66	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_65	You have to wedge it in there really hard to get the thing to seat .
2_kitchen_neg_67	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_66	6 .
2_kitchen_neg_68	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_67	The vacuum is terrible on rugs , on any of the floor height settings .
2_kitchen_neg_69	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_68	It bunches up the rugs
2_kitchen_neg_70	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_69	and starts smoking baby .
2_kitchen_neg_71	negative	True	2_kitchen_neg_70	My old vac was not much better
2_kitchen_neg_72	positive	False	2_kitchen_neg_71	but at least with the old one
2_kitchen_neg_73	positive	False	2_kitchen_neg_72	I could lift the vac and kind of drag
2_kitchen_neg_74	positive	False	2_kitchen_neg_73	it over the rug
2_kitchen_neg_75	positive	False	2_kitchen_neg_74	and it would n't get all
2_kitchen_neg_76	positive	False	2_kitchen_neg_75	caught up .
2_kitchen_neg_77	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_76	I tried the same thing with the Dirt Devil
2_kitchen_neg_78	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_77	and forget about it .
2_kitchen_neg_79	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_78	It jammed up every time .
2_kitchen_neg_80	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_79	7 .
2_kitchen_neg_81	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_80	The vacuum is poor at getting dirt off of hard surface floors .
2_kitchen_neg_82	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_81	It just moves the dirt around or spits it out the back .
2_kitchen_neg_83	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_82	I have to use the hose attachment .
2_kitchen_neg_84	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_83	8 .
2_kitchen_neg_85	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_84	The vacuum is horrible on steps .
2_kitchen_neg_86	positive	False	2_kitchen_neg_85	With my old vac
2_kitchen_neg_87	positive	False	2_kitchen_neg_86	I could drag the vac across each step whilst the vacuum is locked in the upright position .
2_kitchen_neg_88	positive	False	2_kitchen_neg_87	Easy deal .
2_kitchen_neg_89	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_88	The Dirt Devil does not work that way .
2_kitchen_neg_90	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_89	When the vacuum is in the upright position the brush is too high off the carpet to do any good .
2_kitchen_neg_91	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_90	The only option is to disengage the lock and vacuum with the back slanted .
2_kitchen_neg_92	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_91	One little problem with that .
2_kitchen_neg_93	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_92	The weight of the vac cause the seal at the base of the dirt canister to open and air begins leaking .
2_kitchen_neg_94	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_93	You do n't get a good positive suction .
2_kitchen_neg_95	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_94	So ,
2_kitchen_neg_96	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_95	you have to play with the position of the tilt to get the proper seal .
2_kitchen_neg_97	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_96	The problem is that the proper position you need is so close to
2_kitchen_neg_98	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_97	where the vacuum locks into the upright position .
2_kitchen_neg_99	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_98	It often locks and so then you have to try and un-lock it
2_kitchen_neg_100	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_99	while balancing this heavy behemoth .
2_kitchen_neg_101	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_100	It 's a joke .
2_kitchen_neg_102	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_101	The only half easy way to do steps is if use the detachable hose
2_kitchen_neg_103	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_102	and attach the power brush .
2_kitchen_neg_104	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_103	The only problem with that is you are fighting the ill designed hose and heavy vacuum , and not to mention
2_kitchen_neg_105	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_104	that the brush attachment will only really get surface dirt .
2_kitchen_neg_106	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_105	If you try putting pressure for some deep cleaning the brush stops .
2_kitchen_neg_107	positive	False	2_kitchen_neg_106	Now for Pros :

2_kitchen_neg_109	positive	False	2_kitchen_neg_108	It has good suction
2_kitchen_neg_110	positive	False	2_kitchen_neg_109	and it raises the carpet fibers right up .
2_kitchen_neg_111	positive	False	2_kitchen_neg_110	It almost makes my carpet look like new ,
2_kitchen_neg_112	positive	False	2_kitchen_neg_111	and I do not see an excessive amount of carpet fibers in the dirt canister .
2_kitchen_neg_113	positive	False	2_kitchen_neg_112	Some vacuums like to just tear up carpets .
2_kitchen_neg_114	positive	False	2_kitchen_neg_113	2 . The rotating brush attachment works pretty good for removing cat hair off of couches and bedding .
2_kitchen_neg_115	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_114	All in all this vacuum was very very poorly designed .
2_kitchen_neg_116	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_115	I may just have to donate this thing
2_kitchen_neg_117	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_116	and buy something else .
2_kitchen_neg_118	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_117	I ca n't imagine fighting this thing
2_kitchen_neg_119	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_118	every week
2_kitchen_neg_120	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_119	for years to come or until the motor dies .
2_kitchen_neg_121	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_120	Maybe I ` ll be lucky
2_kitchen_neg_122	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_121	and the motor will die soon .
2_kitchen_neg_123	negative	False	2_kitchen_neg_122	Then I ` ll just throw the darn thing out
