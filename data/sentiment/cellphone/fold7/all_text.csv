7_cell_pos_1	Almost 2 years ago , my fiance and I signed up for a 2-year contract with Verizon .
7_cell_pos_2	We got a great deal for both phones .
7_cell_pos_3	And two years later , both phones are in excellent condition with very few scratches and dents .
7_cell_pos_4	This is a great phone for someone
7_cell_pos_5	who would still like the option to take pictures and short videos
7_cell_pos_6	but does not use it heavily .
7_cell_pos_7	I have 38 pictures
7_cell_pos_8	saved on my phone right now and sending picture messages is extremely easy and relatively quick with this phone .
7_cell_pos_9	Pros :
7_cell_pos_10	- Sturdy :
7_cell_pos_11	It 's not as thin or flimsy as some of the newer ultra-thin phones .
7_cell_pos_12	I have dropped my phone
7_cell_pos_13	so many times and my phone is still in excellent condition .
7_cell_pos_14	Another thing I really like is that
7_cell_pos_15	when you drop the phone ,
7_cell_pos_16	the battery does n't detach easily .
7_cell_pos_17	Everytime I dropped my old sony ericsson ,
7_cell_pos_18	the battery would also detach and I 'd have to restart my phone .
7_cell_pos_19	- Compact :
7_cell_pos_20	Though it is on the thicker side , this Samsung is very compact but not too small
7_cell_pos_21	where you fear
7_cell_pos_22	loosing it .
7_cell_pos_23	- Good Buttons :
7_cell_pos_24	For those
7_cell_pos_25	who text message a lot , the way the buttons feel can really make a difference .
7_cell_pos_26	The buttons on this phone are smooth and great for texting .
7_cell_pos_27	- Menu & short cuts :
7_cell_pos_28	On the side of the phone ,
7_cell_pos_29	you can adjust your ringtone volume by simply pressing the up or down arrow .
7_cell_pos_30	If you hold # , your phone goes into vibrate mode .
7_cell_pos_31	If press the camera button on the right hand side of the phone the camera & video menu pop up .
7_cell_pos_32	You can also choose
7_cell_pos_33	which shortcut
7_cell_pos_34	you 'd like
7_cell_pos_35	"when you press "" up , """
7_cell_pos_36	I have mine
7_cell_pos_37	set on the calendar .
7_cell_pos_38	- Long battery life :
7_cell_pos_39	I 'm not one to spend hours on my cell phone ,
7_cell_pos_40	but for every day use , this phone is great with respect
7_cell_pos_41	to its battery life .
7_cell_pos_42	There have been times
7_cell_pos_43	when I forget to charge my phone
7_cell_pos_44	and go 2 days without charging
7_cell_pos_45	and it is still close to fully
7_cell_pos_46	charged .
7_cell_pos_47	- Camera has flash & other neat options :
7_cell_pos_48	"You can also adjust the brightness level , have a self timer , take multiple shots , 10 different "" fun frames , """
7_cell_pos_49	and 5 different colortones like sepia , monochrome
7_cell_pos_50	-LRB- black & white and negative .
7_cell_pos_51	- Zoom :
7_cell_pos_52	You can zoom upto X4 .
7_cell_pos_53	- Phonebook :
7_cell_pos_54	Contacts are easy to access and it 's easy to search for entries .
7_cell_pos_55	I like the fact
7_cell_pos_56	that you can enter multiple numbers under one name .
7_cell_pos_57	You can enter that persons home , mobile , fax , office and pager number .
7_cell_pos_58	You can also enter an alias and email address .
7_cell_pos_59	You can assign a personalized ring tone and picture and you can categorize your contacts in different groups .
7_cell_pos_60	- Voice commands :
7_cell_pos_61	By pressing & holding the \* button , a voice command menu appears .
7_cell_pos_62	It 's a nice feature
7_cell_pos_63	but is not something
7_cell_pos_64	I often use .
7_cell_pos_65	- Speed dailing :
7_cell_pos_66	One feature that I do take advantage of is speed dailing .
7_cell_pos_67	It 's nice only having to press a button
7_cell_pos_68	to instantly connect with another person .
7_cell_pos_69	- Menu styles :
7_cell_pos_70	There are 2 different menu styles
7_cell_pos_71	you can use .
7_cell_pos_72	I like the nature option
7_cell_pos_73	which has cute animation for each subcategory
7_cell_pos_74	you scroll through .
7_cell_pos_75	My fiance uses the icon style
7_cell_pos_76	which is a more simple design .
7_cell_pos_77	- Custom welcome
7_cell_pos_78	and goodbye screen .
7_cell_pos_79	Cons :
7_cell_pos_80	- Video quality is poor and very pixelated .
7_cell_pos_81	My phone only holds 2 15-second videos .
7_cell_pos_82	- Despite the generous 15 ring tones ,
7_cell_pos_83	it 's hard finding a ringtone
7_cell_pos_84	that does n't make
7_cell_pos_85	you want to pull your hair out .
7_cell_pos_86	Out of the 15 ring tones ,
7_cell_pos_87	there are only about 2 decent ring tones .
7_cell_pos_88	- Antenna :
7_cell_pos_89	I do n't use the antenna very often
7_cell_pos_90	but when I do ,
7_cell_pos_91	it has a hard time staying up
7_cell_pos_92	and is very flimsy .
7_cell_pos_93	- Picture quality is not the best .
7_cell_pos_94	If you intend on taking a lot of pictures
7_cell_pos_95	I would recommend investing in a better picture phone .
7_cell_pos_96	- Does not have V-Cast .
7_cell_pos_97	- No MP3 player .
7_cell_pos_98	Overall :
7_cell_pos_99	This cell phone is exactly
7_cell_pos_100	that , a cell phone to make calls .
7_cell_pos_101	It has some additional features like picture taking and video and organization tools like the phonebook and planner
7_cell_pos_102	but it is still a fairly basic phone .
