2_kitchen_neg_1	Well after reading the reviews of this vacuum ,
2_kitchen_neg_2	I decided to give it a try .
2_kitchen_neg_3	I have had it a month now and I have to say
2_kitchen_neg_4	that I am sorry
2_kitchen_neg_5	I bought this behemoth .
2_kitchen_neg_6	Right out of the box
2_kitchen_neg_7	and trying it for the first time I noticed things
2_kitchen_neg_8	that I did n't like .
2_kitchen_neg_9	I thought I 'd give it some time though and hoped
2_kitchen_neg_10	I could adjust .
2_kitchen_neg_11	Here is what I found :
2_kitchen_neg_12	1 . The vacuum is very heavy
2_kitchen_neg_13	as other reviewers have stated .
2_kitchen_neg_14	2 . Worse than the vacuum
2_kitchen_neg_15	being heavy ,
2_kitchen_neg_16	the darn thing is really hard to push .
2_kitchen_neg_17	Even on hard smooth surfaces
2_kitchen_neg_18	it 's hard to push .
2_kitchen_neg_19	I have not figured out yet what the heck would cause it to have so much drag .
2_kitchen_neg_20	For it to drag on hard surfaces ,
2_kitchen_neg_21	it must be a design flaw .
2_kitchen_neg_22	3 . The on\/off power switch is foot
2_kitchen_neg_23	operated .
2_kitchen_neg_24	Not a terrible thing
2_kitchen_neg_25	but Dirt Devil decided to put the darn thing out of view
2_kitchen_neg_26	and hidden by the accessory carriage .
2_kitchen_neg_27	On my first time of vacuuming I accidentally ran over a sock
2_kitchen_neg_28	and it got caught in the floor brush .
2_kitchen_neg_29	While the brush belt was smoking I fumbled around for the damn power switch .
2_kitchen_neg_30	I finally had to reach down
2_kitchen_neg_31	and press the switch by hand
2_kitchen_neg_32	because I could n't find it by looking down .
2_kitchen_neg_33	It must have taking me eight to ten seconds to finally turn the thing off .
2_kitchen_neg_34	Unfortunately , the damage was done .
2_kitchen_neg_35	The belt snapped .
2_kitchen_neg_36	How nice .
2_kitchen_neg_37	I really liked that .
2_kitchen_neg_38	First time out and the belt snapped .
2_kitchen_neg_39	Another note about the switch ;
2_kitchen_neg_40	there have been times
2_kitchen_neg_41	I have had to repeatedly press the switch
2_kitchen_neg_42	because it would not lock off .
2_kitchen_neg_43	It takes a firm steady pressure
2_kitchen_neg_44	to turn it off .
2_kitchen_neg_45	The fun part of this annoyance is that you think
2_kitchen_neg_46	you have it turned off
2_kitchen_neg_47	because the motor starts winding down
2_kitchen_neg_48	and as soon as you let up on it the motor powers up .
2_kitchen_neg_49	Couple that with not being able to really see the darn thing
2_kitchen_neg_50	it 's a real challenge .
2_kitchen_neg_51	Maybe Dirt Devil thinks we have eyes on our toes .
2_kitchen_neg_52	Hey Dirt Devil here is an idea .
2_kitchen_neg_53	How about putting the on\/off switch on the push handle .
2_kitchen_neg_54	What a novel idea .
2_kitchen_neg_55	Doh !
2_kitchen_neg_56	4 . The vacuum hose that detaches is really unwieldy .
2_kitchen_neg_57	It has a long plastic handle
2_kitchen_neg_58	that you hold onto and
2_kitchen_neg_59	that makes it really difficult to manipulate the hose .
2_kitchen_neg_60	The main reason being is that the hose it too short .
2_kitchen_neg_61	It 's like you are fighting the hose all the time .
2_kitchen_neg_62	It gets
2_kitchen_neg_63	tiring .
2_kitchen_neg_64	5 .
2_kitchen_neg_65	The detachable hose is really hard to re-install in it 's port .
2_kitchen_neg_66	You have to wedge it in there really hard to get the thing to seat .
2_kitchen_neg_67	6 .
2_kitchen_neg_68	The vacuum is terrible on rugs , on any of the floor height settings .
2_kitchen_neg_69	It bunches up the rugs
2_kitchen_neg_70	and starts smoking baby .
2_kitchen_neg_71	My old vac was not much better
2_kitchen_neg_72	but at least with the old one
2_kitchen_neg_73	I could lift the vac and kind of drag
2_kitchen_neg_74	it over the rug
2_kitchen_neg_75	and it would n't get all
2_kitchen_neg_76	caught up .
2_kitchen_neg_77	I tried the same thing with the Dirt Devil
2_kitchen_neg_78	and forget about it .
2_kitchen_neg_79	It jammed up every time .
2_kitchen_neg_80	7 .
2_kitchen_neg_81	The vacuum is poor at getting dirt off of hard surface floors .
2_kitchen_neg_82	It just moves the dirt around or spits it out the back .
2_kitchen_neg_83	I have to use the hose attachment .
2_kitchen_neg_84	8 .
2_kitchen_neg_85	The vacuum is horrible on steps .
2_kitchen_neg_86	With my old vac
2_kitchen_neg_87	I could drag the vac across each step whilst the vacuum is locked in the upright position .
2_kitchen_neg_88	Easy deal .
2_kitchen_neg_89	The Dirt Devil does not work that way .
2_kitchen_neg_90	When the vacuum is in the upright position the brush is too high off the carpet to do any good .
2_kitchen_neg_91	The only option is to disengage the lock and vacuum with the back slanted .
2_kitchen_neg_92	One little problem with that .
2_kitchen_neg_93	The weight of the vac cause the seal at the base of the dirt canister to open and air begins leaking .
2_kitchen_neg_94	You do n't get a good positive suction .
2_kitchen_neg_95	So ,
2_kitchen_neg_96	you have to play with the position of the tilt to get the proper seal .
2_kitchen_neg_97	The problem is that the proper position you need is so close to
2_kitchen_neg_98	where the vacuum locks into the upright position .
2_kitchen_neg_99	It often locks and so then you have to try and un-lock it
2_kitchen_neg_100	while balancing this heavy behemoth .
2_kitchen_neg_101	It 's a joke .
2_kitchen_neg_102	The only half easy way to do steps is if use the detachable hose
2_kitchen_neg_103	and attach the power brush .
2_kitchen_neg_104	The only problem with that is you are fighting the ill designed hose and heavy vacuum , and not to mention
2_kitchen_neg_105	that the brush attachment will only really get surface dirt .
2_kitchen_neg_106	If you try putting pressure for some deep cleaning the brush stops .
2_kitchen_neg_107	Now for Pros :
2_kitchen_neg_108	1 . The vacuum does seem to get the carpets pretty clean .
2_kitchen_neg_109	It has good suction
2_kitchen_neg_110	and it raises the carpet fibers right up .
2_kitchen_neg_111	It almost makes my carpet look like new ,
2_kitchen_neg_112	and I do not see an excessive amount of carpet fibers in the dirt canister .
2_kitchen_neg_113	Some vacuums like to just tear up carpets .
2_kitchen_neg_114	2 . The rotating brush attachment works pretty good for removing cat hair off of couches and bedding .
2_kitchen_neg_115	All in all this vacuum was very very poorly designed .
2_kitchen_neg_116	I may just have to donate this thing
2_kitchen_neg_117	and buy something else .
2_kitchen_neg_118	I ca n't imagine fighting this thing
2_kitchen_neg_119	every week
2_kitchen_neg_120	for years to come or until the motor dies .
2_kitchen_neg_121	Maybe I ` ll be lucky
2_kitchen_neg_122	and the motor will die soon .
2_kitchen_neg_123	Then I ` ll just throw the darn thing out
2_kitchen_neg_124	and buy something other than Dirt Devil .
2_kitchen_neg_125	Steve
