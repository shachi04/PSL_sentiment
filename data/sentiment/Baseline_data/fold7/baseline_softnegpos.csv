positive	0.625	0.25	I  wanted  a  smart  phone 
positive	0.0001	0.5	so  I  could  check  my  email 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	so  I  gravitated  to  the  Treo  680  so  I  could  stay  with  a  Palm  product  and  so  I  could  stay  with  my  current  mobile  provider  ,  Cingular  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	Now  I  am 
negative	0.125	0.0001	counting  the  days 
negative	0.0001	0.5	until  my  2  year  commitment  ends 
negative	0.875	0.0001	so  I  can  punt  this  awful  ,  awful  product  .

negative	0.0001	0.5	and  pay  off  my  commitment  early 
negative	0.0001	0.125	just  so  I  can  get  rid  of  it  . 
negative	0.375	0.25	The  battery  problem  is  huge  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	You  must  remember  to  stick  this  in  a  charger 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	whenever  you  can  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	If  you  forget  and  leave  it  in  your  pocket  overnight  then  it  will  be  dead  the  next  day  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	I  have  turned  off  every  thing 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  can  find  that  sucks  power 
negative	0.125	0.125	and  it  still  drains  amazingly  fast  . 
negative	0.25	0.1875	It  wo  n't  even  last  a  day  if  you  make  very  many  calls  . 
negative	0.125	0.375	The  reception  is  terrible  . 
negative	0.125	0.35	I  `  ve  had  a  Cingular  phone  for  a  long  time  and  was  able  to  get  good  reception  over  most  of  So  .

negative	0.0001	0.0001	With  this  phone 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  think 
negative	0.125	0.25	you  have  to  be  right  underneath  an  antenna 
negative	0.0001	0.125	to  get  a  signal  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	I  was  on  a  conference 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	call  yesterday 
negative	0.0001	0.125	and  got  dropped  twice  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	I  am  envious  everytime

negative	0.0001	0.0001	who  can  talk  on  their  cell  phone 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	because  mine  will  freeze  up  any  time

positive	0.0001	0.25	Yes  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	it  freezes  up  often  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	The  only  way  I  have  found  to  unfreeze  it  is  to  take  out  the  battery 
negative	0.75	0.0001	and  let  it  do  a  hard  reboot  . 
negative	0.4375	0.25	The  versa  mail  program  that  it  came  with  from  Cingular  is  hard  to  work  with  . 
negative	0.0001	0.5	You  must  leave  your  work  computer  on  to  check  the  corporate  mail  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	That  means  if  I  am  traveling  with  my  computer  , 
negative	0.625	0.0001	the  phone  's  corporate  mail  program  will  not  work  . 
negative	0.625	0.0001	It  often  will  not  sync  anyway  . 
negative	0.5	0.0001	I  do  n't  think  the  browser 
negative	0.6875	0.3125	that  comes  with  the  phone  will  work  with  Java  ,  so  I  can  not  check  my  Yahoo  mail  either  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  tried 
negative	0.75	0.125	going  back  and  forth  to  the  pre-Java  version  of  Yahoo 
negative	0.375	0.1875	and  that  is  too  much  of  a  pain  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	I  get  all  kinds  of  weird  messages  with  the  phone  . 
negative	0.125	0.20833333333333331	I  have  n't  ever  been  able  to  sync  up  the  Palm  features  because  of  some  legacy  files  from  my  previus  palm  software  ,  something 
negative	0.625	0.0001	that  never  happened 
negative	0.0001	0.5	when  I  upgraded  before  . 
positive	0.0001	0.25	Yes  , 
positive	0.125	0.25	there  is  a  manual 
positive	0.125	0.25	that  is  huge  . 
negative	0.125	0.16666666666666666	It  is  hard  to  use  on  line  so  I  guess 
negative	0.25	0.25	I  need 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  bite  the  bullet 
negative	0.0001	0.125	and  print  out  the  whole  thing 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  then  take  a  week  of  vacation 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  read  it 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  see  if  I  can  make  any

negative	0.0001	0.3125	Hardly  a  week  goes  by  that  I  do  n't  actively  think 
negative	0.75	0.0001	how  much  I  hate  this  phone  . 
negative	0.0001	0.20833333333333331	I  actually  signed  on  to  Amazon  today 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	just  to  write  this 
negative	0.125	0.20833333333333331	because  the  phone  was  n't  working  properly  today  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	What  a  piece 
negative	0.375	0.0001	of  junk  ! 
positive	0.0001	0.25	Almost  2  years  ago  ,  my  fiance  and  I  signed  up  for  a  2-year  contract  with  Verizon  . 
positive	0.0001	0.125	We  got  a  great  deal  for  both  phones  . 
positive	0.1875	0.25	And  two  years  later  ,  both  phones  are  in  excellent  condition  with  very  few  scratches  and  dents  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	This  is  a  great  phone  for  someone 
positive	0.1875	0.125	who  would  still  like  the  option  to  take  pictures  and  short  videos 
positive	0.625	0.0001	but  does  not  use  it  heavily  . 
positive	0.0001	0.25	I  have  38  pictures

positive	0.125	0.375	so  many  times  and  my  phone  is  still  in  excellent  condition  . 
positive	0.125	0.4375	Another  thing  I  really  like  is  that 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	when  you  drop  the  phone  , 
positive	0.0001	0.25	the  battery  does  n't  detach  easily  . 
positive	0.0001	0.375	Everytime  I  dropped  my  old  sony  ericsson  ,

negative	0.0001	0.0001	Final  advice  :

positive	0.0001	0.125	So  with  this  in  mind 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  will  put  in  my  2  cents  . 
positive	0.0001	0.34375	I  have  had  my  machine  for  two  months  and  I  use  it  about  4  times  a  week  on  a  200  square  foot  vinyl  kitchen  floor  that  accomodates  two  adults  ,  a  4  year  old 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  two  dogs  . 
positive	0.20833333333333331	0.34375	Generally  it  works  pretty  well  and  is  much  more  convenient  than  a  regular  mop  and  bucket  . 
positive	0.1875	0.25	You  must  remember  that  this  is  a  low  cost  residential  machine 
negative	0.46875	0.125	and  as  such  will  not  replace  the  suction  and  scrubbing  power  of  a  serious  vacuum  and  elbow  grease  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	The  machine  is  set  up  to  auto-shut  off 
positive	0.25	0.125	if  you  move  the  machine  quickly  or  drop  it  down  low  . 
negative	0.375	0.625	I  agree  with  with  the  other  writers  about  the  poor  suction  capability 
positive	0.0001	0.125	but  you  must  consider  the  overall  design  of  the  machine  . 
positive	0.0001	0.25	A  powerful  adjustable  head  machine 
positive	0.125	0.25	that  would  pick  up  more  than  dog  hair  and  dust  would  be  cost  prohibitive  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  see 
positive	0.125	0.25	what  Hoover  was  trying  to  do  with  this  machine  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	They  were  trying  to  accomodate  our  scrubbing 
positive	0.125	0.1875	and  vacuuming  needs  in  one  cost  effective  machine  . 
positive	0.125	0.75	They  gave  it  a  good  shot 
negative	0.125	0.125	but  for  all  of  us  clean-freaks  this  machine  does  n't  quite  hit  the  mark  . 
negative	0.40625	0.25	The  water\/cleaning  solution  section  is  ,  in  my  humble  opinion  ,  to  small  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  run  out  of  water  quickly

positive	0.20833333333333331	0.4166666666666667	But  the  good  news  is  that  my  kitchen  is  so  small

positive	0.0001	0.0001	There  's  a  reason  for  this  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	If  you  use  regular  household  cleaners 
negative	0.75	0.125	that  cut  crease  you  will  damage  your  machine

negative	0.25	0.3125	The  grease  cutting  agents  in  regular  household  cleaners  and  soaps  strip  the  bearings 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  fry  the  gaskets  . 
positive	0.375	0.25	So  my  final  opinion  is  this  . 
positive	0.375	0.25	If  you  have  a  relatively  small  space 
positive	0.25	0.25	and  need  a  daily  quick  scrub 
positive	0.25	0.0001	it  's  a  great  time  saver  . 
positive	0.25	0.5	It  's  a  good  overall  cleaner  if  you  need  a  quick  vac-up  of  dog  hair  ,  scrub  and  mop  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Any  more  heavy  duty  than  that 
negative	0.25	0.40625	and  you  are  back  to  the  good  old  vacuum  attachment  ,  mop  and  bucket  routine  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	If  you  are  a  cleanfreak  ,  like  me  , 
negative	0.3125	0.4583333333333333	you  know  that  nothing  replaces  a  good  old  fashioned  hand-and-knees  scrub  . 
positive	0.0001	0.5	No  machine  will  ever  leave  you  satisfied  . 
negative	0.375	0.25	This  machine  was  definately  NOT  made  for  heavy  duty  cleaning 
positive	0.25	0.0001	but  for  light  daily  use 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	it  's  great  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	I  am 
positive	0.125	0.0001	giving  this  machine  4  stars 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	because  I  think 
positive	0.125	0.25	it  does  what  it  was  designed  to  do  .  .  .  light  cleaning  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	I  would  have  given  it  5  stars 
negative	0.125	0.25	if  the  cleaning  solution  bucket  was  larger 
negative	0.3125	0.25	and  the  cut  off  mechanism  was  a  little  more  liberal  and  a  little  more  suction  power 
negative	0.125	0.4583333333333333	would  have  been  nice  . 
positive	0.375	0.0001	When  Hoover  finally  comes  up  with  a  heavy  duty  scrubber  with  the  suction  power  of  a  regular  vacuum  , 
positive	0.25	0.2916666666666667	scrubbing  power  of  my  own  elbow  and  ability  to  get  into  corners  and  baseboards  I  `  ll  be  all  over  it  ! 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Until  then  , 
positive	0.0001	0.625	I  `  ll  settle  for  a  daily  scrub  with  this  machine  and  a  good  hand  scrub  once  a  month  . 
negative	0.375	0.125	We  bought  a  well-reviewed  carpet  vacuum  from  Amazon  last  year  ,

positive	0.25	0.0001	Starting  with  the  dry  vac  part  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	that 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	seems 
negative	0.20833333333333331	0.1875	to  get  smallish  pieces  of  dirt  fine  ,  but  anything  Cheerio  sized  or  larger  it  pushes  around  on  the  floor  unless  you  lean  the  vacuum  back  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	Which  would  be  fine  , 
negative	0.25	0.125	but  if  you  lean  it  back  too  far  , 
negative	0.125	0.25	there  is  a  suction  filter  thing

negative	0.0001	0.0001	for  the  wet  vac  part  -RRB- 
negative	0.375	0.25	that  sticks  and  you  have  to  turn  off  the  vacuum

negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  release  that  piece

positive	0.0001	0.0001	Anyway  ,

negative	0.0001	0.125	we  got  this  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Very  disappointing  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	We  used  the  included  cleaner  ,  warm  tap  water  ,  etc  as  the  directions  indicated  , 
negative	0.125	0.25	and  both  my  wife  and  I  swear  the  floor  is  no  cleaner  than  when  we  started  .

positive	0.125	0.25	that  was  a  '  2  cup  style  '  . 
negative	0.375	0.25	I  have  not  found  it  to  be  a  huge  deal 
negative	0.375	0.0001	to  use  2  smaller  ' 
negative	0.375	0.125	1  cup  '  size  pods  , 
positive	0.20833333333333331	0.375	but  it  sounded  nice  to  be  able  to  just  put  one  large  pod  in  the  machine  instead  of  2  smaller  one  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	After  reading  some  of  the  reviews  here  , 
negative	0.625	0.0001	I  could  not  figure  out 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	what  some  of  the  reviewers  meant  by  the  Kona  pods 
negative	0.3125	0.375	making  different  amount  of  coffee  per  cup  each  time  or  how  the  coffee  could  be  strange  and  undrinkable  . 
negative	0.0001	0.375	It  just  did  n't  make  sense  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Well  , 
negative	0.125	0.375	it  still  does  n't  make  sense  , 
negative	0.0001	0.25	but  it  certainly  happened  with  the  coffee 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  made  using  the  Kona  pods  also  . 
negative	0.28125	0.25	My  results  were  overall  poor  and  it  was  very  disappointing  as  the  Kona  pods  cost  a  lot  more  than  Folgers  or  other  pod  brands  that  I  can  buy  locally  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	The  first  thing  I  noticed  was  that  the  coffee  in  the  2  cup  sized  Kona  pods  is  packed  in  much 
negative	0.625	0.0001	more  tightly  than  in  any  other  pod 
negative	0.0001	0.25	I  have  ever  used  in  my  Senseo  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	The  instructions  for  the  Kona  pods  say 
negative	0.125	0.25	to  wiggle  the  pods  to  break  up  the  coffee  before  inserting  into  the  machine  . 
negative	0.20833333333333331	0.16666666666666666	The  Kona  pods  feel  very  hard 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	when  taken  out  of  their  package  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  always  wiggled  and  jiggled  the  pods  for  about  10  seconds 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	before  putting  them  in  the  Senseo  . 
negative	0.625	0.0001	After  my  problems  with  the  Kona  pods  , 
negative	0.375	0.25	my  husband  decided  that  I  was  not  '  wiggling  ' 
negative	0.0001	0.125	them  enough  . 
negative	0.25	0.25	He  promptly  wiggled  one  to  the  point  that  it  broke  open  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	So  , 
negative	0.125	0.1875	there  is  just  so  much 
negative	0.125	0.25	that  can  be  done  to  the  pod 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	before  putting  it  in  the  machine  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	The  first  thing  that  I  noticed  was  that  the  amount  of  coffee 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	brewed 
negative	0.3125	0.25	when  using  the  Kona  pod  was  quite  a  bit  less  than  when  using  2  smaller  pods  . 
negative	0.625	0.375	That  did  not  make  much  sense  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	but  after  several  cups  of  Kona  , 
negative	0.125	0.375	it  was  obvious 
negative	0.375	0.25	that  there  was  never  the  amount  of  coffee 
negative	0.375	0.0001	coming  out  as  before  when  using  2  small  one  cup  pods  . 
negative	0.125	0.5	The  best  I  can  figure  out  is  that  the  Kona  pods 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	themselves  seem  to  '  hold  '  a  lot  more  water  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	There  is  more  water 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	that  remains  in  the  pod  itself 
negative	0.125	0.25	after  the  brewing  is  done  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	The  pod  itself  is  heavier 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	when  I  take 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	it  out  to  throw  it  away  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	So  , 
negative	0.0001	0.125	I  believe 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	the  reason 
negative	0.3125	0.20833333333333331	that  there  is  less  actual  coffee  using  Kona  pods  is  that  the  pods  themselves  retain  a  lot  more  water 
negative	0.625	0.0001	and  it  can  not  pass  through  into  the  coffee  cup  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Then  , 
negative	0.0001	0.25	as  others  have  mentioned  , 
negative	0.375	0.25	there  is  the  problem 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	that  happens  to  me  about  1\/2  the  time 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	when  using  the  Kona  pods  . 
negative	0.375	0.25	The  problem  is  that  for  whatever  reason  , 
negative	0.625	0.375	the  water  does  not  actually  go  through 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  penetrate  the  Kona  pods  during  the  brewing  cycle  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	The  '  coffee  ' 
negative	0.125	0.25	that  is  supposed  to  be  coming  out  of  the  spout  is  just  water  ! 
negative	0.375	0.4375	This  problem  is  one  that  I  still  can  not  really  figure  out  . 
negative	0.375	0.25	The  Kona  pods  are  a  little  smaller  in  diameter  than  all  the  other  pods 
negative	0.0001	0.25	I  have  tried  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	So  , 
negative	0.5	0.15625	I  guess  that  somehow  the  water  has  enough  room  to  '  go  around  '  the  actual  pod 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  come  out  of  the  spout  without  '  going  through  '  the  pod 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  brew  coffee  . 
negative	0.375	0.4375	I  also  wonder  if  the  paper  filter  of  the  Kona  pods  is  different  than  other  pods 
negative	0.4375	0.25	and  for  some  reason  the  Kona  paper  is  more  difficult  for  water 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  penetrate  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	I  have  tried 
negative	0.0001	0.25	wetting  the  Kona  pod  paper  filter  right  before  starting  to  brew  the  coffee 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	thinking  that  perhaps  it  would  help  the  water 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  penetrate  the  paper  and  pod  . 
negative	0.625	0.25	But  ,  that  has  not  worked  for  me  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	So  , 
negative	0.1875	0.1875	it  is  back  to  regular  more  reasonably  priced  coffee  pods  for  me  . 
negative	0.25	0.225	I  have  wasted  too  many  expensive  Kona  pods  trying  to  get  a  proper  cup  of  coffee  from  them  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	Even  when  the  Kona  pods  brew  a  cup  of  coffee  , 
negative	0.2916666666666667	0.20833333333333331	it  is  not  as  large  of  an  amount  of  coffee  as  I  get 
negative	0.625	0.0001	using  other  brands  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	So  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	adding  the  cost  of  the  Kona  pods  to  the  fact 
negative	0.375	0.0001	that  it  brews  a  smaller  amount  of  coffee  equals  a  product 
negative	0.1875	0.2916666666666667	that  is  way  too  expensive 
negative	0.0001	0.375	when  it  does  actually  work  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	I  have  been  reading  of  a  product 
negative	0.0001	0.25	called  an  EcoPod  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	It  is  a  refillable  pod  for  these  type  of  coffeemakers  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	It  might  be  the  next  thing 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  try  .
