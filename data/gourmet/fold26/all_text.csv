6_gourmet_neg_1	Do n't get
6_gourmet_neg_2	me wrong --
6_gourmet_neg_3	I 'm not some nut job
6_gourmet_neg_4	who thinks this stuff will give you cancer due to lack of testing .
6_gourmet_neg_5	I 'm just really miffed at the fact
6_gourmet_neg_6	that Splenda has plenty of carbohydrates in it -- 24 grams per cup ! !
6_gourmet_neg_7	They get away with this by setting their serving size to 1 tsp ,
6_gourmet_neg_8	which is 0.5 g .
6_gourmet_neg_9	Would you believe that in 0.5 g of product
6_gourmet_neg_10	there is less than one gram of carbohydrate ! ?
6_gourmet_neg_11	No way ! !
6_gourmet_neg_12	The sweetener sucralose is not a carbohydrate ,
6_gourmet_neg_13	but since it 's 600x as sweet as sugar ,
6_gourmet_neg_14	they need
6_gourmet_neg_15	to bulk it up to make
6_gourmet_neg_16	it measure like sugar .
6_gourmet_neg_17	But all the maltodextrin they use for filler is carbohydrates .
6_gourmet_neg_18	This could really screw up somebody on Atkins ' Induction phase .
6_gourmet_neg_19	For example ,
6_gourmet_neg_20	the day before I learned this ,
6_gourmet_neg_21	I made some Kool-Aid with Splenda .
6_gourmet_neg_22	I did n't know
6_gourmet_neg_23	that in 2 quarts
6_gourmet_neg_24	I was drinking down 24 carbs !
6_gourmet_neg_25	What to do ?
6_gourmet_neg_26	Find somebody online
6_gourmet_neg_27	who sells liquid sucralose .
6_gourmet_neg_28	They use water as the filler ,
6_gourmet_neg_29	it 's super-concentrated still ,
6_gourmet_neg_30	and it truly has 0 carbs .
6_gourmet_neg_31	I look forward to the day
6_gourmet_neg_32	when McNeil Nutritionals meets the demand for ZERO-carb Splenda .
6_gourmet_neg_33	-LRB- That 's 0.0 g , not 0.49 g !
