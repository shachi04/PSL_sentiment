18_kitchen_neg_1	"Do not be tricked into buying an "" easy "" sharpener ."
18_kitchen_neg_2	They DO NOT work .
18_kitchen_neg_3	Spend the same money
18_kitchen_neg_4	-LRB- or less ! -RRB-
18_kitchen_neg_5	on a good stone set that has various angles
18_kitchen_neg_6	-LRB- i.e. Lansky , w \/ 17 , 20 , 25 , and 30 degree angles ,
18_kitchen_neg_7	and 3-5 stones :
18_kitchen_neg_8	"use 20 degrees for your "" slicing """
18_kitchen_neg_9	and paring knives ,
18_kitchen_neg_10	and 25 degrees for you
18_kitchen_neg_11	chefs -RRB- .
18_kitchen_neg_12	I opted for the stone set
18_kitchen_neg_13	-LRB- I 'm a bit of a purist -RRB- ,
18_kitchen_neg_14	but I ` ve heard good remarks about the diamond set , too ;
18_kitchen_neg_15	the 3 grit set is all
18_kitchen_neg_16	you really need :
18_kitchen_neg_17	coarse , medium , and fine - get the ultra fine if your sharpening razors and such .
18_kitchen_neg_18	With proper care , and light steel use
18_kitchen_neg_19	-LRB- it 's the re-aligning tool , not the sharpening device - be gentle -RRB- ,
18_kitchen_neg_20	you ` ll probably only need to touch-up your edge
18_kitchen_neg_21	once every year or two ,
18_kitchen_neg_22	depending on the work load you put on your knife .
18_kitchen_neg_23	But ,
18_kitchen_neg_24	if you do seriously muck the edge up ,
18_kitchen_neg_25	you ` ll have a system
18_kitchen_neg_26	"that can repair your knife to "" good as new "" condition ."
18_kitchen_neg_27	My chef fell onto the tile floor , point first ,
18_kitchen_neg_28	and I had a wonderfully sharpened instrument 30 minutes later .
18_kitchen_neg_29	The normal touch-up takes less than 5 minutes per blade .
18_kitchen_neg_30	And ,
18_kitchen_neg_31	at thirty dollars
18_kitchen_neg_32	to have 5 knives professionally sharpened ,
18_kitchen_neg_33	you ` ll be ahead of the game
18_kitchen_neg_34	after the first use !
18_kitchen_neg_35	Hint :
18_kitchen_neg_36	use a 5X + magnifying glass\/loupe to inspect your edge - by carefully rolling the knife
18_kitchen_neg_37	to catch a bright light source ,
18_kitchen_neg_38	you ` ll be able to see shiny spots
18_kitchen_neg_39	where the edge still needs to be sharpened .
18_kitchen_neg_40	You can also take a look at your edge
18_kitchen_neg_41	before using the steel ,
18_kitchen_neg_42	and see
18_kitchen_neg_43	how bad you roll the edge
18_kitchen_neg_44	while working with it ,
18_kitchen_neg_45	then see
18_kitchen_neg_46	how it becomes magically aligned after the use of the steel .
18_kitchen_neg_47	And , see chips and voids in your lower quality steel knives -
18_kitchen_neg_48	I admit I have a couple ,
18_kitchen_neg_49	myself .
18_kitchen_neg_50	In short :
18_kitchen_neg_51	get
18_kitchen_neg_52	stoned ,
18_kitchen_neg_53	not
18_kitchen_neg_54	taken
