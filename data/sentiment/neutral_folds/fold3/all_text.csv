17_cell_neg_1	 I  would  n't  buy  this 
17_cell_neg_2	 unless  it  's  an  emergency  , 
17_cell_neg_3	 because  it  's  one  of  those  chargers 
17_cell_neg_4	 that  reports  errors  , 
17_cell_neg_5	 and  makes  your  phone  start  beeping  non-stop 
17_cell_neg_6	 when  it  's  done  charging  . 
17_cell_neg_7	 I  do  n't  want  this 
17_cell_neg_8	 because  I  like  charging  at  night  ,  the  other  chargers  do  n't  do  this 
17_cell_neg_9	 -LRB-  I  guess  what  it  does  is  it  starts  fluctuating  power  from  the  wall  ,  like  switching  off  , 
17_cell_neg_10	 when  the  battery  is  fully  charged  .  . 
17_cell_neg_11	 so  it  beeps  as  if  it  's  being  plugged  in  over 
17_cell_neg_12	 and  over  -RRB-  . 
17_cell_neg_13	 When  I  first  got  it  , 
17_cell_neg_14	 I  was  trying  to  carefully  plug  it  into  my  phone  --  and  I  did  n't  want  to  damage  the  little  metal  things  inside  my  phone  OR  on  the  charger  . 
17_cell_neg_15	 It  was  n't  going  in  smoothly 
17_cell_neg_16	 and  it  did  n't  match  up 
17_cell_neg_17	 or  seem  to  fit  inside  at  ALL  . 
17_cell_neg_18	 So  I  went  a  day  without  a  phone 
17_cell_neg_19	 and  I  did  more  research  to  see 
17_cell_neg_20	 why  the  heck  they  'd  lie  that  it  fit  my  phone  . 
17_cell_neg_21	 Finally  I  got 
17_cell_neg_22	 fed  up 
17_cell_neg_23	 because  I  could  n't  find  another  charger  ANYWHERE 
17_cell_neg_24	 where  I  live 
17_cell_neg_25	 and  I  tried 
17_cell_neg_26	 forcing  it  . 
17_cell_neg_27	FINALLY
17_cell_neg_28	 it  fit  ! 
17_cell_neg_29	 But  I  had  to  shove  it  in  .  . 
17_cell_neg_30	 who  knows  if  it  was  damaging  my  phone  . 
17_cell_neg_31	 But  it  was  charging 
17_cell_neg_32	 so  I  was  happy 
17_cell_neg_33	 -LRB-  my  cell  is  my  only  phone  .  . 
17_cell_neg_34	 so  I  was  cut  off  from  the  world  -RRB-  . 
17_cell_neg_35	 Then  I  tried  getting  it  out 
17_cell_neg_36	 and  could  n't  figure  it  out  ! 
17_cell_neg_37	 I  had  to  jimmy  it  off  , 
17_cell_neg_38	 and  broke  off  one  of  the  side  hooks 
17_cell_neg_39	 that  helps  it  secure  itself  . 
17_cell_neg_40	 I  was  able  to  put  it  back  on  ,  and  finally  learned  a  routine  so  to  speak  ,  for  taking  it  off  , 
17_cell_neg_41	 but  it  's  cheap  . 
17_cell_neg_42	 It  's  very  cheap  . 
17_cell_neg_43	 So  ,  the  charger  works  , 
17_cell_neg_44	 but  it  's  very  hard  to  use  and  it  is  n't  convenient  at  all  . 
17_cell_neg_45	 I  do  n't  recommend  it 
17_cell_neg_46	 unless  it  's  an  emergency  . 
17_cell_neg_47	 For  me  , 
17_cell_neg_48	 it  was 
3_cell_neg_1	 I  `  ve  used  the  Palm  OS  going  on  10  years  now  . 
3_cell_neg_2	 When  my  Treo  270  died  , 
3_cell_neg_3	 I  bought  a  used  270  on  Ebay  . 
3_cell_neg_4	 Eventually  that  one  died  too 
3_cell_neg_5	 and  I  bought  an  unlocked  650  on  Amazon  . 
3_cell_neg_6	" ""I  called  Palm  """"  tech  support  """""" "
3_cell_neg_7	 on  issues 
3_cell_neg_8	 I  had  with  it 
3_cell_neg_9	 -LRB-  dial  up  networking 
3_cell_neg_10	 did  n't  work  on  internal  browser  with  T-Mobile  -RRB-  . 
3_cell_neg_11	 Forgive  me  for  saying  it  , 
3_cell_neg_12	 but  the  guy  at  Palm  support  was  as  dumb  as  dumb  can  be  . 
3_cell_neg_13	 I  got  someone 
3_cell_neg_14	overseas
3_cell_neg_15	 who  told 
3_cell_neg_16	 me  one  inaccurate  thing 
3_cell_neg_17	 after  another  -LRB-  he  insisted 
3_cell_neg_18	 that  my  Treo  270  never  allowed  dial  up  networking  with  the  internal  browser  - 
3_cell_neg_19	 even  though  I  told  him  first  hand 
3_cell_neg_20	 that  I  used  it  all  the  time  -  did 
3_cell_neg_21	 he  think 
3_cell_neg_22	 I  was  lying  to  him  ?  -RRB-  . 
3_cell_neg_23	 He  knew  nothing 
3_cell_neg_24	 about  the  phone 
3_cell_neg_25	 and  kept  deferring  to  a  supervisor  ,  constantly  keeping  me  on  hold 
3_cell_neg_26	 and  it  was  just  a  huge  waste  of  time  . 
3_cell_neg_27	 After  a  few  calls  like  this  with  no  resolution 
3_cell_neg_28	 I  gave  up 
3_cell_neg_29	 and  decided  to  return  the  650  . 
3_cell_neg_30	 I  then  tried  the  T-Mobile  MDA  . 
3_cell_neg_31	 I  was  uneasy  of  the  idea  of  switching  to  Windows  PocketPC 
3_cell_neg_32	 but  decided  to  give  it  a  try  . 
3_cell_neg_33	 For  me 
3_cell_neg_34	 it  was  a  huge  mistake  -  Pocket  PC  is  a  joke  and  completely  unintuitive  . 
3_cell_neg_35	 They  expect  you  to  study 
3_cell_neg_36	 how  to  use  their  OS 
3_cell_neg_37	 in  order  to  make  use  of  its  clumsy  interface  . 
3_cell_neg_38	 Friends  tell  me  they  sell  3rd  party  applications 
3_cell_neg_39	 that  make 
3_cell_neg_40	 it  easier 
3_cell_neg_41	 to  use  ,  but  c'mon  - 
3_cell_neg_42	 when  you  buy  a  phone 
3_cell_neg_43	 you  expect  it  to  work  right  from  the  beginning  - 
3_cell_neg_44	 I  do  n't  want  to  have  to  spend  time  learning  and  installing  additional  software  for  it  to  work  properly  . 
3_cell_neg_45	 Finally  , 
3_cell_neg_46	 I  give  up  on  Pocket  PC 
3_cell_neg_47	 -LRB-  sold  it  on  Ebay  -RRB- 
3_cell_neg_48	 and  give  Palm  another  try 
3_cell_neg_49	 when  I  see  the  680  come  out  . 
3_cell_neg_50	 The  dialup 
3_cell_neg_51	 networking  issue  is  no  longer  a  problem  on  the  680 
3_cell_neg_52	-LRB-
3_cell_neg_53	 as  compared  to  the  650  -RRB- 
3_cell_neg_54	and
3_cell_neg_55	 I  buy 
3_cell_neg_56	 it  unlocked  directly  from  Palm  . 
3_cell_neg_57	 Overall  , 
3_cell_neg_58	 it  's  a  decent  phone 
3_cell_neg_59	 and  I  just  feel  way  more  comfortable  with  Palm  OS  over  Pocket  PC  . 
3_cell_neg_60	 Palm  customer  support  is  still  useless  and  , 
3_cell_neg_61	 as  others  have  mentioned  , 
3_cell_neg_62	 the  lack  of  a  standard  Mini-USB  connector  is  simply  inexcusable  . 
3_cell_neg_63	 Still  , 
3_cell_neg_64	 I  'm  much  happier  with  Palm-OS  over  Pocket  PC  . 
3_cell_neg_65	 As  I  use  it  , 
3_cell_neg_66	 I  see  that  the  battery  does  n't  seem  to  last  very  long 
3_cell_neg_67	 -LRB-  just  over  2  hours  of  talktime  at  the  most  -RRB-  . 
3_cell_neg_68	 I  hesitantly  call 
3_cell_neg_69	 Palm  support  and  get  some  flunkie  again  - 
3_cell_neg_70	" ""I  decide  to  cut  my  losses  and  stop  wasting  my  time  with  their  """"  support  """"  ."" "
3_cell_neg_71	 I  'm  just  going  to  buy  a  second  battery  and  second  charger  to  keep  the  phone 
3_cell_neg_72	 charged  . 
3_cell_neg_73	 I  hate  the  idea  of  making  such  a  compromise  , 
3_cell_neg_74	 but  for  me 
3_cell_neg_75	 it  's  the  lesser  of  two  evils  . 
3_cell_neg_76	 The  fact  that  Palm  would  release  a  phone  with  such  terrible  battery  life  is  indicative  of  their  customer  mindset  . 
3_cell_neg_77	 They  just  do  n't  care  . 
3_cell_neg_78	 As  clunky  as  my  Windows  MDA  was  ,  its  battery  life  was  at  least  3  to  4  times 
3_cell_neg_79	 what  the  Treo  gives  me 
3_cell_neg_80	 -LRB-  even  though  the  MDA  has  a  much  bigger  screen  -RRB-  . 
3_cell_neg_81	 IMHO  the  Smartphone  market  is  still  going  through  growing  pains  - 
3_cell_neg_82	 The  original  Handspring  Treo  was  designed  by  good  people  , 
3_cell_neg_83	 when  Palm  bought  them  out  they  cashed  in  on  the  Treo  product  line 
3_cell_neg_84	 but  the  customer  oriented  mentality  of  Handspring  went  right  out  the  window  -  along  with  any  intelligent  design  evolution  of  the  Treo  . 
3_cell_neg_85	 Most  of  the  better  designed  smartphones  on  the  market 
3_cell_neg_86	 -LRB-  Samsung  ,  Motorola  ,  HTC  Wizard  -RRB- 
3_cell_neg_87	 are  all 
3_cell_neg_88	 made  for  Pocket  PC 
3_cell_neg_89	 because  Microsoft  has  used  it  's  clout 
3_cell_neg_90	 to  take  over  the  market  . 
3_cell_neg_91	 I  just  wish  other  manufacturers  offered  Palm-OS  based  smartphones  again  -  this  way 
3_cell_neg_92	 you  'd  get  the  intuitive  interface  of  Palm  , 
3_cell_neg_93	 without  having  to  be  limited  to  Palm  's  poorly  designed  hardware  . 
3_cell_neg_94	 .  .  .  maybe  it  's  time  I  finally  give  the  Blackberry  a  try  .  .  .  : 
10_cell_pos_1	 I  `  ve  had  this  phone  for  about  a  week  now  and  I  'm  glad 
10_cell_pos_2	 I  waited  to  post  a  review 
10_cell_pos_3	 because  my  initial  reaction  was  not  very  positive  . 
10_cell_pos_4	 Coming  from  owning  a  RAZR  and  many  Windows-based  devices  , 
10_cell_pos_5	 there  was  an  initial  learning  curve  to  some  of  the  functions  . 
10_cell_pos_6	 Also  ,  I  was  NOT  convinced  that  the  strange  keyboard  would  really  recognize  what  you  were  attempting  to  type  . 
10_cell_pos_7	 Boy  was  I  wrong  about  that  one  . 
10_cell_pos_8	 OK  ,  so  for  the  review  . 
10_cell_pos_9	 My  motivation  for  purchasing  was  primarily  to  get  a  PHONE  first  ,  with  a  few  bells  and  whistles  for  when  I  just  want  to  play  with  the  device  . 
10_cell_pos_10	 The  Pearl  fits  that  bill  perfectly  . 
10_cell_pos_11	 Phone  quality  is  excellent  . 
10_cell_pos_12	 Loading  ringtones 
10_cell_pos_13	 -LRB-  a  pain  at  first  -RRB- 
10_cell_pos_14	proved
10_cell_pos_15	 to  be  relatively  easy 
10_cell_pos_16	 once  I  did  a  little  research  . 
10_cell_pos_17	 Ringtones  play  very  loud  and  clear  . 
10_cell_pos_18	 The  music  player  is  MUCH  better 
10_cell_pos_19	 than  first  impressions  would  lead  you 
10_cell_pos_20	 to  believe  . 
10_cell_pos_21	 After  a  few  hours  of  frustration  , 
10_cell_pos_22	 I  was  all  ready  to  purchase  a  3rd  party  app  . 
10_cell_pos_23	 Again  ,  did  some  research  , 
10_cell_pos_24	 visited  a  few  forums  , 
10_cell_pos_25	 and  found  out 
10_cell_pos_26	 there  is  much  more  functionality  in  the  included  music  player  than  you  might  realize  . 
10_cell_pos_27	 As  an  owner  of  a  NANO  , 
10_cell_pos_28	 I  was  disappointed  with  the  interface  of  the  player  . 
10_cell_pos_29	 But  once  you  go  into  the  menu  functions  , 
10_cell_pos_30	 you  `  ll  find  much  more  functionality  . 
10_cell_pos_31	 It  's  not  an  ipod  , 
10_cell_pos_32	 but  it  works  as  an  decent  replacement  . 
10_cell_pos_33	 And  if  you  `  re  not  an  ipod  owner  , 
10_cell_pos_34	 you  `  ll  likely  have  no  complaints  . 
10_cell_pos_35	 Sound  of  tunes  is  quite  nice 
10_cell_pos_36	 when  using  headphones  . 
10_cell_pos_37	 Camera  is  only  so-so  , 
10_cell_pos_38	 but  I  do  n't  really  care  about  that 
10_cell_pos_39	 anyway  . 
10_cell_pos_40	 Must  admit  that  I  thought 
10_cell_pos_41	 it  would  be  better 
10_cell_pos_42	 since  it  is  a  megapixal  camera  . 
10_cell_pos_43	 The  couple  of  pictures 
10_cell_pos_44	 I  took  were  dark  and  somewhat  grainy  . 
10_cell_pos_45	 Part  of  why  I  dropped  my  rating  from  5  stars  . 
10_cell_pos_46	 As  far  as  email  , 
10_cell_pos_47	 I  have  a  BB  from  work 
10_cell_pos_48	 and  they  wo  n't  let  me  use  a  non-work  issued  device  to  access  the  network  ,  so  I  have  no  opinion  on  email  functionality  . 
10_cell_pos_49	 Organizer  features 
10_cell_pos_50	 -LRB-  calendar  ,  tasks  ,  notes  , 
10_cell_pos_51	 etc  -RRB-  seem  more  than  adequate  . 
10_cell_pos_52	 Much  better  than  any  of  my  old  Pocket  PC  devices  . 
10_cell_pos_53	 The  only  complaints  I  would  have  is  that  there  are  still  2  basic  things 
10_cell_pos_54	 that  I  have  n't  been  able  to  figure  out 
10_cell_pos_55	 and  while  I  'm  admittingly  not  a  techie  , 
10_cell_pos_56	 these  should  be  pretty  basic  and  intuitive  . 
10_cell_pos_57	 One  , 
10_cell_pos_58	 I  would  like  to  set  one  of  my  ringtones  as  the  default  ringer  . 
10_cell_pos_59	 That  should  be  fairly  simplistic 
10_cell_pos_60	 but  I  ca  n't  figure  it  out  . 
10_cell_pos_61	 Two  , 
10_cell_pos_62	 I  would  like  to  change  the  order  of  the  icons  on  some  of  the  themes  . 
10_cell_pos_63	 Again  ,  should  be  pretty  basic  , 
10_cell_pos_64	 but  no  go  . 
10_cell_pos_65	 Almost  forgot  ,  ca  n't  listen  to  music  through  bluetooth  . 
10_cell_pos_66	 Not  sure  why  , 
10_cell_pos_67	 but  this  is  really  my  only  MAJOR  complaint  . 
10_cell_pos_68	 Only  minor  complaints  . 
10_cell_pos_69	 All  in  all  ,  a  pretty  sweet  device  . 
10_cell_pos_70	 And  BTW  ,  form  factor  and  looks  are  simply  the  best  out  there  . 
10_cell_pos_71	 I  came  so  close  to  purchasing  the  Blackjack  ,  very  happy 
10_cell_pos_72	 that  I  went  with  the  Pearl  . 
10_cell_pos_73	 UPDATE  - 
10_cell_pos_74	 Figured  out 
10_cell_pos_75	 how  to  set  default  ringtone  and  move  icons  . 
10_cell_pos_76	 Coming  from  a  Windows  mobile  environment  , 
10_cell_pos_77	 I  was  expecting  something  along  the  lines  of  : 
10_cell_pos_78	 Start-programs-etc-etc  . 
10_cell_pos_79	 Everyting  in  windows  takes  so  many  keystroks  . 
10_cell_pos_80	 With  the  Pearl  , 
10_cell_pos_81	 it  was  so  easy  . 
10_cell_pos_82	 I  was  simply  expecting  it  to  be  much  more  difficult  based  on  my  prior  experience  . 
10_cell_pos_83	 I  'm  going  to  still  keep  it  at  4  stars 
10_cell_pos_84	 because  of  the  lack  of  BT  stereo  . 
10_cell_pos_85	 Otherwise  , 
10_cell_pos_86	 as  close  to  a  perfect  device  as  I  `  ve  used 
10_cell_pos_87	 -LRB-  and  I  `  ve  used  quite  a  few  -RRB- 
12_cell_pos_1	 I  just  purchased  this  phone  four  days  ago 
12_cell_pos_2	 and  have  been  impressed  with  it  for  the  most  part  . 
12_cell_pos_3	 The  first  thing  you  `  ll  notice  is  how  crisp  and  clear  the  screen  is  . 
12_cell_pos_4	 This  is  a  slider  phone  , 
12_cell_pos_5	 and  thankfully  you  can  do  most  things  without  sliding  the  screen 
12_cell_pos_6	 to  expose  the  number  keys  . 
12_cell_pos_7	 The  only  things  that  I  can  think  of  thus  far 
12_cell_pos_8	 that  requires  you  to  expose  the  keys  is  to  dial  a  new  number 
12_cell_pos_9	 that  's  not  in  your  contacts  and  to  text  message  . 
12_cell_pos_10	 Next  , 
12_cell_pos_11	 we  go  to  the  features  . 
12_cell_pos_12	 So  we  got  a  1.3  MP  camera  ,  camcorder  ,  music  player  ,  1GB  microSD  card  ,  bluetooth  support  ,  and  infrared  port  .  . 
12_cell_pos_13	 and  \*  drumroll  please  \*  an  FM  radio  . 
12_cell_pos_14	 Now  ,  the  FM  radio  is  n't  satellite 
12_cell_pos_15	 based  ,  so  you  can  not  pick  up  radio  stations  from  across  the  U.  S  .  , 
12_cell_pos_16	 just  those  stations  local  to  you  . 
12_cell_pos_17	 Now  I  will  go  into  the  good  and  bad  things  about  each  feature  : 
12_cell_pos_18	 1  .  Camera  -  Impressive  picture  quality  . 
12_cell_pos_19	 Yes  it  's  only  1.3  MP  compared  to  those  8MP  digital  cameras  , 
12_cell_pos_20	 but  can  you  show  me  a  camera 
12_cell_pos_21	 that  does  what  this  phone  does  ? 
12_cell_pos_22	5\/5
12_cell_pos_23	 2  .  Camcorder  -  Not  all  that  impressive  . 
12_cell_pos_24	 While  you  are  recording  , 
12_cell_pos_25	 the  quality  seems  perfect  . 
12_cell_pos_26	 However  , 
12_cell_pos_27	 once  you  play  it  , 
12_cell_pos_28	 it  turns  a  bit  distorted  . 
12_cell_pos_29	 Plus  , 
12_cell_pos_30	 it  only  allows  for  20  seconds  of  recording  time  regardless  of  the  size  of  your  microSD  card  . 
12_cell_pos_31	3\/5
12_cell_pos_32	 3  .  Music  Player  -  Impressive  . 
12_cell_pos_33	 The  speaker  is  of  good  quality  ,  and  very  loud  . 
12_cell_pos_34	 However  , 
12_cell_pos_35	 I  still  could  not  find  a  way  to  change  the  order  of  the  songs  without  making  a  playlist  . 
12_cell_pos_36	 There  's  play  ,  pause  ,  next  song  ,  previous  song  ,  fast  forward  ,  and  rewind  features 
12_cell_pos_37	 as  buttons  as  shown  in  the  pictures  . 
12_cell_pos_38	 The  buttons  must  be  pressed  fairly  hard  , 
12_cell_pos_39	 so  your  music  wo  n't  start  playing  spontaneously  in  your  pocket  . 
12_cell_pos_40	 Also  ,  I  was  blown  away  on  how  the  quality  of  the  music  improves 
12_cell_pos_41	 once  you  put  on  those  stock  earbuds  . 
12_cell_pos_42	4\/5
12_cell_pos_43	 4  .  FM  Radio  -  I  bet  those 
12_cell_pos_44	 that  have  this  phone  tried  to  use  the  radio 
12_cell_pos_45	 but  stopped  short 
12_cell_pos_46	 and  told  you 
12_cell_pos_47	 to  buy  an  enhancement  . 
12_cell_pos_48	 Well  ,  the  truth  is  you  do  n't  need  to  buy  anything  extra  . 
12_cell_pos_49	 Just  plug  in  the  earbuds

12_cell_pos_52	 and  will  allow  you  to  hear  stations  . 
12_cell_pos_53	 And  since  you  need  the  earbuds  to  hear  the  radio  , 
12_cell_pos_54	 yes  the  sound  will  go  to  the  earbuds  . 
12_cell_pos_55	 However  , 
12_cell_pos_56	 there  's  a  '  loudspeaker  '  option 
12_cell_pos_57	 that  allows  the  radio  to  be  played  through  the  external  speaker  , 
12_cell_pos_58	 but  you  still  need  to  keep  the  earbuds  plugged  in  , 
12_cell_pos_59	 as  it  serves  as  the  '  antenna  '  . 
12_cell_pos_60	 This  means  that  if  you  want  to  hear  the  radio  on  your  phone  , 
12_cell_pos_61	 you  NEED  to  have  the  earbuds  with  you  . 
12_cell_pos_62	 You  may  need  to  play  around  with  the  position  of  the  phone  and  antenna

11_gourmet_neg_2	 who  would  love  to  have  an  elk  carcass  for  their  holiday  . 
11_gourmet_neg_3	 Birthdays  ,  Christmas  ,  Hanukkah  ,  Martin  Luther  King  Jr.  '  s  Birthday  Observed  ,  Grandparent  's  Day  ,  etc  .  are  all  holidays 
11_gourmet_neg_4	 where  a  big  piece  of  elk  meat  could  brighten  someone  's  day  . 
11_gourmet_neg_5	 But  watch  out  !  !  ! 
11_gourmet_neg_6	 I  have  often  used  Amazon  in  order  to  buy  gifts  , 
11_gourmet_neg_7	 and  with  this  elk  carcass  GIFT  WRAPPING  IS  NOT  AN  OPTION  . 
11_gourmet_neg_8	 I  would  think 
11_gourmet_neg_9	 that  half  the  fun  of  giving  a  huge  elk  carcass  would  be  watching  the  look 
11_gourmet_neg_10	 on  your  loved  one  's  face  as  he  or  she  unwrapped  the  slab  of  meat  . 
11_gourmet_neg_11	 Unfortunately  ,  Amazon  does  not  think 
11_gourmet_neg_12	 this  is  so  . 
11_gourmet_neg_13	 With  the  weight  of  the  product  , 
11_gourmet_neg_14	 I  think 
11_gourmet_neg_15	 it  is  going  to  be  difficult  to  wrap  this  on  my  own  . 
11_gourmet_neg_16	 Sorry  Uncle  Tino  ,  no  elk  carcass  for  Columbus  Day  this  year  ! 
20_gourmet_pos_1	 Rings-Ding  's  are  the  best  snacks  out  there  for  many  a  reasons  . 
20_gourmet_pos_2	 First  off  , 
20_gourmet_pos_3	 they  are  the  best  after  dinner  snacks  out  there  . 
20_gourmet_pos_4	 It  's  really  like  a  cake  ,  just  more  condensed  and  not  as  fatty  or  filling  . 
20_gourmet_pos_5	 Also  ,  these  things  are  addicting  . 
20_gourmet_pos_6	 In  my  life  , 
20_gourmet_pos_7	 I  can  not  even  count  how  much  packs 
20_gourmet_pos_8	 I  have  consumed  , 
20_gourmet_pos_9	 since  I  have  been  eating  these  things  everyday 
20_gourmet_pos_10	 since  I  was  young  , 
20_gourmet_pos_11	 and  let  's  just  say 
20_gourmet_pos_12	 now  I  am  very  old  . 
20_gourmet_pos_13	 If  you  can  not  afford  drugs  , 
20_gourmet_pos_14	 then  go  for  the  ring-ding  's  . 
20_gourmet_pos_15	 The  only  negative  about  these  things  if  there  is  n't  enough  cream  , 
20_gourmet_pos_16	 then  you  get  a  mouthful  of  chocolate  . 
20_gourmet_pos_17	 Most  people  I  know  like  the  chocolate  , 
20_gourmet_pos_18	 but  I  personally  would  not  like  a  mouthful  of  it  . 
20_gourmet_pos_19	 Another  bad  thing  is  in  the  summer  , 
20_gourmet_pos_20	 they  are  melted  and  can  only  be  slightly  revived  if  refrigerated  . 
20_gourmet_pos_21	 They  kind  of  lose  that  good  flavor  edge  in  the  summer  , 
20_gourmet_pos_22	 which  makes  this  the  perfect  snack  for  the  winter  . 
20_gourmet_pos_23	 Alright  .  .  . 
20_gourmet_pos_24	 the  anatomy  of  a  ring-ding 
20_gourmet_pos_25	 -LRB-  DUN-DUN-DUN  -RRB-  . 
20_gourmet_pos_26	 First  off  , 
20_gourmet_pos_27	 you  get  a  chocolatey  outside 
20_gourmet_pos_28	 that  is  pretty  soft  . 
20_gourmet_pos_29	 In  the  center  is  a  creamy  sensation 
20_gourmet_pos_30	 -LRB-  sorry  if  that  sounded  dirty  .  .  .  get  your  mind  out  of  the  gutter  -RRB- 
20_gourmet_pos_31	that
20_gourmet_pos_32	 really  makes  this  product  go  from  good  to  great  . 
20_gourmet_pos_33	 Put  that  together 
20_gourmet_pos_34	 and  you  get  probably  the  best  snack  out  there  right  now  . 
20_gourmet_pos_35	 They  come  two  in  a  pack 
20_gourmet_pos_36	 and  are  made  by  Drake  's  . 
20_gourmet_pos_37	 Usually  ,  Drake  's  is  in  the  shadow  of  Hostess  , 
20_gourmet_pos_38	 yet  I  feel  Drake  's  destroys  Hostess  in  terms  of  their  cakes  . 
20_gourmet_pos_39	 If  you  are  actually  reading  this  ,  please  do  n't  destroy  me  for  saying 
20_gourmet_pos_40	 that  Ring-Ding  's  totally  annihilates  anything  Hostess  has  ever  put  out  . 
20_gourmet_pos_41	 Wow  .  .  . 
20_gourmet_pos_42	 I  managed  to  make  a  food  product  two  paragraphs  long 
20_gourmet_pos_43	 -LRB-  two  short  paragraphs  I  should  say  -RRB-  . 
20_gourmet_pos_44	 I  would  put  the  whole  history  of  the  Ring-Ding  in  , 
20_gourmet_pos_45	 but  that  would  probably  be  taking  someone  else  's  work  . 
20_gourmet_pos_46	 I  guess  I  `  ll  stop  now  . 
20_gourmet_pos_47	 Anyway  ,  Ring-Ding  's  for  the  win  !  !

4_gourmet_pos_33	 It  is  unclear  , 
4_gourmet_pos_34	 though  ,  from  their  web  site  , 
4_gourmet_pos_35	 how  many  of  their  ingredients  are  organic  or  kosher  ,

4_gourmet_pos_37	 in  their  teas 
4_gourmet_pos_38	--
4_gourmet_pos_39	 this  wording  seems  a  little  vague  for  a  super  premium  tea  . 
4_gourmet_pos_40	 In  general 
4_gourmet_pos_41	 I  'm  not  a  big  fan  of  tea  with  flavorings  added  , 
4_gourmet_pos_42	 preferring  the  subtleness  and  authentic  taste  of  the  real  thing  . 
4_gourmet_pos_43	 Overall  ,  the  green  teas  seem  good  . 
4_gourmet_pos_44	 The  herbal  infusions  are  fine  . 
4_gourmet_pos_45	 The  black  teas  tend  to  turn  bitter  if  you  do  n't  brew  them  very  briefly  .  .  . 
4_gourmet_pos_46	 even  then  they  have  bitter  overtones  . 
4_gourmet_pos_47	 Tazo  's  assortment  ,  and  Tazo  teas  in  general  ,  are  fine  --  better  than  premium  teas  like  Stash  or  Celestial  Seasonings  -- 
4_gourmet_pos_48	 but  not  anywhere  near  as  good  as  Numi  ,  or  Aspen  ,  or  other  super  premium  teas 
4_gourmet_pos_49	" ""made  with  only  """"  real  """"  ingredients  and  minus  all  of  the  flavorings  ."" "
4_gourmet_pos_50	 I  'm  more  used  to  these  high  quality  teas  , 
4_gourmet_pos_51	 which  Tazo  attempts  to  be  , 
4_gourmet_pos_52	 but  disappoints  .  .  . 
4_gourmet_pos_53	 so  overall  Tazo  Assorted  gets  a  3.5  to  a  4  . 
4_gourmet_pos_54	 For  this  review  , 
4_gourmet_pos_55	 I  'm  rounding  up  , 
4_gourmet_pos_56	 since  so  many  people  seem  to  enjoy  these  teas  , 
4_gourmet_pos_57	 and  I  'm  in  the  clear  minority  . 
4_gourmet_pos_58	 If  your  tea  experience  so  far  is  drinking  commercial  teas  of  a  lower  quality  ,  no  doubt  Tazo  's  teas  will  appeal  to  you  , 
4_gourmet_pos_59	 as  they  are  a  great  improvement  . 
4_gourmet_pos_60	 They  have  a  lot  of  variety  and  many  interesting  tea  experiences  . 
4_gourmet_pos_61	 If  you  do  n't  enjoy  Tazo  's  teas  ,  though  ,  know 
4_gourmet_pos_62	 that  there  are  many  ,  many  teas  made  with  all  real  ingredients  ,  teas 
4_gourmet_pos_63	 that  cost  only  a  fraction  more  , 
4_gourmet_pos_64	 that  may  be  just  the  thing 
4_gourmet_pos_65	 you  were  looking  for  .

19_kitchen_neg_1	 The  vacuum  has  great  suction  . 
19_kitchen_neg_2	 However  ,  suction  is  the  only  good  quality  about  this  vacuum  . 
19_kitchen_neg_3	 I  purchased  this  vacuum  at  Sears 
19_kitchen_neg_4	 and  got  a  good  discount  during  their  vacuum  sale  . 
19_kitchen_neg_5	 But  I  have  gone  through  3  of  these  vacuums 
19_kitchen_neg_6	 and  have  returned  or  plan  on  returning  each  one  . 
19_kitchen_neg_7	 The  1st  vacuum  got 
19_kitchen_neg_8	 so  much  dirt  stuck  behind  and  in  the  hepa  filter  ,  the  vacuum  started  making  a  sound  like  it  was  going  to  break  . 
19_kitchen_neg_9	 The  2nd  vacuum  had  a  handle 
19_kitchen_neg_10	 that  was  assembled  badly  so  with  each  forward 
19_kitchen_neg_11	 and  backward  pass  the  handle  felt  like  it  was  going  to  come  off  . 
19_kitchen_neg_12	 This  vacuum  is  hard  to  push  . 
19_kitchen_neg_13	 You  have  to  put  the  carpet 
19_kitchen_neg_14	 setting  at  close  to  high  for  low  carpeting  . 
19_kitchen_neg_15	 On  hard  surfaces  the  vacuum  is  hard  to  push  too  ! 
19_kitchen_neg_16	 This  vacuum  has  a  large  dust  cup  with  2  sections  . 
19_kitchen_neg_17	" ""The  small  compartment  in  the  back  of  the  dust  cup  is  -LRB-  1  """""" "
19_kitchen_neg_18	" ""high  X  5  """""" "
19_kitchen_neg_19	" ""wide  X  6  """""" "
19_kitchen_neg_20	 deep  -RRB-  for  the  dirt  . 
19_kitchen_neg_21	 The  large  front  section  collects  the  hair  ,  crumbs  and  other  larger  things  you  pick  up  off  the  floor  in  your  home  ,  however  dirt  and  fine  particulate  dust  is  what  I  collect  in  my  vacuum  , 
19_kitchen_neg_22	 and  Hoover  only  gives  you  that  little  compartment  for  the  dirt 
19_kitchen_neg_23	 so  it  gets  caught  in  the  vacuum  behind  the  hepa  filter  . 
19_kitchen_neg_24	 You  spend  more  time  cleaning  out  the  vacuum 
19_kitchen_neg_25	 than  you  do  vacuuming  your  carpet  . 
19_kitchen_neg_26	 Today  I  had  to  pick  up  the  vacuum 
19_kitchen_neg_27	 and  shake  it  over  the  trash 
19_kitchen_neg_28	 can  to  get  most  of  the  dirt  out  from  behind  the  hepa  filter  . 
19_kitchen_neg_29	 Even  my  husband  noticed  that  this  vacuum  takes  too  much  time  to  empty  and  clean  out  . 
19_kitchen_neg_30	 Yes  lots  of  dirt  falls  onto  the  vacuum 
19_kitchen_neg_31	 when  you  remove  the  dust  cup 
19_kitchen_neg_32	 and  is  messy  to  clean  up  . 
19_kitchen_neg_33	 I  have  tried  Kenmore  ,  Eureka  ,  and  Fantom  in  the  past  . 
19_kitchen_neg_34	 I  plan  on  returning  the  3rd  vacuum 
19_kitchen_neg_35	 once  I  get  my  Dyson 
19_kitchen_neg_36	 I  purchased  from  HSN 
2_kitchen_neg_1	 Well  after  reading  the  reviews  of  this  vacuum  , 
2_kitchen_neg_2	 I  decided  to  give  it  a  try  . 
2_kitchen_neg_3	 I  have  had  it  a  month  now  and  I  have  to  say 
2_kitchen_neg_4	 that  I  am  sorry 
2_kitchen_neg_5	 I  bought  this  behemoth  . 
2_kitchen_neg_6	 Right  out  of  the  box 
2_kitchen_neg_7	 and  trying  it  for  the  first  time  I  noticed  things 
2_kitchen_neg_8	 that  I  did  n't  like  . 
2_kitchen_neg_9	 I  thought  I  'd  give  it  some  time  though  and  hoped 
2_kitchen_neg_10	 I  could  adjust  . 
2_kitchen_neg_11	 Here  is  what  I  found  : 
2_kitchen_neg_12	 1  .  The  vacuum  is  very  heavy 
2_kitchen_neg_13	 as  other  reviewers  have  stated  . 
2_kitchen_neg_14	 2  .  Worse  than  the  vacuum 
2_kitchen_neg_15	 being  heavy  , 
2_kitchen_neg_16	 the  darn  thing  is  really  hard  to  push  . 
2_kitchen_neg_17	 Even  on  hard  smooth  surfaces 
2_kitchen_neg_18	 it  's  hard  to  push  . 
2_kitchen_neg_19	 I  have  not  figured  out  yet  what  the  heck  would  cause  it  to  have  so  much  drag  . 
2_kitchen_neg_20	 For  it  to  drag  on  hard  surfaces  , 
2_kitchen_neg_21	 it  must  be  a  design  flaw  . 
2_kitchen_neg_22	 3  .  The  on\/off  power  switch  is  foot 
2_kitchen_neg_23	 operated  . 
2_kitchen_neg_24	 Not  a  terrible  thing 
2_kitchen_neg_25	 but  Dirt  Devil  decided  to  put  the  darn  thing  out  of  view 
2_kitchen_neg_26	 and  hidden  by  the  accessory  carriage  . 
2_kitchen_neg_27	 On  my  first  time  of  vacuuming  I  accidentally  ran  over  a  sock 
2_kitchen_neg_28	 and  it  got  caught  in  the  floor  brush  . 
2_kitchen_neg_29	 While  the  brush  belt  was  smoking  I  fumbled  around  for  the  damn  power  switch  . 
2_kitchen_neg_30	 I  finally  had  to  reach  down 
2_kitchen_neg_31	 and  press  the  switch  by  hand 
2_kitchen_neg_32	 because  I  could  n't  find  it  by  looking  down  . 
2_kitchen_neg_33	 It  must  have  taking  me  eight  to  ten  seconds  to  finally  turn  the  thing  off  . 
2_kitchen_neg_34	 Unfortunately  ,  the  damage  was  done  . 
2_kitchen_neg_35	 The  belt  snapped  . 
2_kitchen_neg_36	 How  nice  . 
2_kitchen_neg_37	 I  really  liked  that  . 
2_kitchen_neg_38	 First  time  out  and  the  belt  snapped  . 
2_kitchen_neg_39	 Another  note  about  the  switch  ; 
2_kitchen_neg_40	 there  have  been  times 
2_kitchen_neg_41	 I  have  had  to  repeatedly  press  the  switch 
2_kitchen_neg_42	 because  it  would  not  lock  off  . 
2_kitchen_neg_43	 It  takes  a  firm  steady  pressure 
2_kitchen_neg_44	 to  turn  it  off  . 
2_kitchen_neg_45	 The  fun  part  of  this  annoyance  is  that  you  think 
2_kitchen_neg_46	 you  have  it  turned  off 
2_kitchen_neg_47	 because  the  motor  starts  winding  down 
2_kitchen_neg_48	 and  as  soon  as  you  let  up  on  it  the  motor  powers  up  . 
2_kitchen_neg_49	 Couple  that  with  not  being  able  to  really  see  the  darn  thing 
2_kitchen_neg_50	 it  's  a  real  challenge  . 
2_kitchen_neg_51	 Maybe  Dirt  Devil  thinks  we  have  eyes  on  our  toes  . 
2_kitchen_neg_52	 Hey  Dirt  Devil  here  is  an  idea  . 
2_kitchen_neg_53	 How  about  putting  the  on\/off  switch  on  the  push  handle  . 
2_kitchen_neg_54	 What  a  novel  idea  . 
2_kitchen_neg_55	 Doh  ! 
2_kitchen_neg_56	 4  .  The  vacuum  hose  that  detaches  is  really  unwieldy  . 
2_kitchen_neg_57	 It  has  a  long  plastic  handle 
2_kitchen_neg_58	 that  you  hold  onto  and 
2_kitchen_neg_59	 that  makes  it  really  difficult  to  manipulate  the  hose  . 
2_kitchen_neg_60	 The  main  reason  being  is  that  the  hose  it  too  short  . 
2_kitchen_neg_61	 It  's  like  you  are  fighting  the  hose  all  the  time  . 
2_kitchen_neg_62	 It  gets 
2_kitchen_neg_63	 tiring  . 
2_kitchen_neg_64	 5  . 
2_kitchen_neg_65	 The  detachable  hose  is  really  hard  to  re-install  in  it  's  port  . 
2_kitchen_neg_66	 You  have  to  wedge  it  in  there  really  hard  to  get  the  thing  to  seat  . 
2_kitchen_neg_67	 6  . 
2_kitchen_neg_68	 The  vacuum  is  terrible  on  rugs  ,  on  any  of  the  floor  height  settings  . 
2_kitchen_neg_69	 It  bunches  up  the  rugs 
2_kitchen_neg_70	 and  starts  smoking  baby  . 
2_kitchen_neg_71	 My  old  vac  was  not  much  better 
2_kitchen_neg_72	 but  at  least  with  the  old  one 
2_kitchen_neg_73	 I  could  lift  the  vac  and  kind  of  drag 
2_kitchen_neg_74	 it  over  the  rug 
2_kitchen_neg_75	 and  it  would  n't  get  all 
2_kitchen_neg_76	 caught  up  . 
2_kitchen_neg_77	 I  tried  the  same  thing  with  the  Dirt  Devil 
2_kitchen_neg_78	 and  forget  about  it  . 
2_kitchen_neg_79	 It  jammed  up  every  time  . 
2_kitchen_neg_80	 7  . 
2_kitchen_neg_81	 The  vacuum  is  poor  at  getting  dirt  off  of  hard  surface  floors  . 
2_kitchen_neg_82	 It  just  moves  the  dirt  around  or  spits  it  out  the  back  . 
2_kitchen_neg_83	 I  have  to  use  the  hose  attachment  . 
2_kitchen_neg_84	 8  . 
2_kitchen_neg_85	 The  vacuum  is  horrible  on  steps  . 
2_kitchen_neg_86	 With  my  old  vac 
2_kitchen_neg_87	 I  could  drag  the  vac  across  each  step  whilst  the  vacuum  is  locked  in  the  upright  position  . 
2_kitchen_neg_88	 Easy  deal  . 
2_kitchen_neg_89	 The  Dirt  Devil  does  not  work  that  way  . 
2_kitchen_neg_90	 When  the  vacuum  is  in  the  upright  position  the  brush  is  too  high  off  the  carpet  to  do  any  good  . 
2_kitchen_neg_91	 The  only  option  is  to  disengage  the  lock  and  vacuum  with  the  back  slanted  . 
2_kitchen_neg_92	 One  little  problem  with  that  . 
2_kitchen_neg_93	 The  weight  of  the  vac  cause  the  seal  at  the  base  of  the  dirt  canister  to  open  and  air  begins  leaking  . 
2_kitchen_neg_94	 You  do  n't  get  a  good  positive  suction  . 
2_kitchen_neg_95	 So  , 
2_kitchen_neg_96	 you  have  to  play  with  the  position  of  the  tilt  to  get  the  proper  seal  . 
2_kitchen_neg_97	 The  problem  is  that  the  proper  position  you  need  is  so  close  to 
2_kitchen_neg_98	 where  the  vacuum  locks  into  the  upright  position  . 
2_kitchen_neg_99	 It  often  locks  and  so  then  you  have  to  try  and  un-lock  it 
2_kitchen_neg_100	 while  balancing  this  heavy  behemoth  . 
2_kitchen_neg_101	 It  's  a  joke  . 
2_kitchen_neg_102	 The  only  half  easy  way  to  do  steps  is  if  use  the  detachable  hose 
2_kitchen_neg_103	 and  attach  the  power  brush  . 
2_kitchen_neg_104	 The  only  problem  with  that  is  you  are  fighting  the  ill  designed  hose  and  heavy  vacuum  ,  and  not  to  mention 
2_kitchen_neg_105	 that  the  brush  attachment  will  only  really  get  surface  dirt  . 
2_kitchen_neg_106	 If  you  try  putting  pressure  for  some  deep  cleaning  the  brush  stops  . 
2_kitchen_neg_107	 Now  for  Pros  : 
2_kitchen_neg_108	 1  .  The  vacuum  does  seem  to  get  the  carpets  pretty  clean  . 
2_kitchen_neg_109	 It  has  good  suction 
2_kitchen_neg_110	 and  it  raises  the  carpet  fibers  right  up  . 
2_kitchen_neg_111	 It  almost  makes  my  carpet  look  like  new  , 
2_kitchen_neg_112	 and  I  do  not  see  an  excessive  amount  of  carpet  fibers  in  the  dirt  canister  . 
2_kitchen_neg_113	 Some  vacuums  like  to  just  tear  up  carpets  . 
2_kitchen_neg_114	 2  .  The  rotating  brush  attachment  works  pretty  good  for  removing  cat  hair  off  of  couches  and  bedding  . 
2_kitchen_neg_115	 All  in  all  this  vacuum  was  very  very  poorly  designed  . 
2_kitchen_neg_116	 I  may  just  have  to  donate  this  thing 
2_kitchen_neg_117	 and  buy  something  else  . 
2_kitchen_neg_118	 I  ca  n't  imagine  fighting  this  thing 
2_kitchen_neg_119	 every  week 
2_kitchen_neg_120	 for  years  to  come  or  until  the  motor  dies  . 
2_kitchen_neg_121	 Maybe  I  `  ll  be  lucky 
2_kitchen_neg_122	 and  the  motor  will  die  soon  . 
2_kitchen_neg_123	 Then  I  `  ll  just  throw  the  darn  thing  out 
2_kitchen_neg_124	 and  buy  something  other  than  Dirt  Devil  . 
2_kitchen_neg_125	Steve
16_kitchen_pos_1	 I  bought  one  of  these  from  a  yard  sale  for  use  at  my  small  office  . 
16_kitchen_pos_2	 I  was  getting  stuck  cleaning  up  the  kitchen 
16_kitchen_pos_3	 and  decided  to  see  if  this  little  unit  was  worth  it  . 
16_kitchen_pos_4	 I  'd 
16_kitchen_pos_5	 looked  at  the  small  Haier  unit 
16_kitchen_pos_6	 and  was  not  impressed  with  the  plastic  interior  . 
16_kitchen_pos_7	 I  broke  a  lot  of  rules 
16_kitchen_pos_8	 setting  this  up  . 
16_kitchen_pos_9	 Its  not  connected  to  the  hot  water  supply  , 
16_kitchen_pos_10	 since  I  have  a  very  old  sink  and  the  only  other  connection 
16_kitchen_pos_11	 I  had  was  to  cold  water  lines  . 
16_kitchen_pos_12	 Also  ,  the  machine  is  on  the  floor  , 
16_kitchen_pos_13	 under  the  sink  . 
16_kitchen_pos_14	 I  bought  new  hoses 
16_kitchen_pos_15	 to  make  the  connections  . 
16_kitchen_pos_16	 Luckily  , 
16_kitchen_pos_17	 the  standard  connectors  on  the  back  made  this  easy  -  the  fill  is  a  standard  clothes  washer  fill  line  , 
16_kitchen_pos_18	 and  the  drain  can  take  a  piece  of  garden  hose  . 
16_kitchen_pos_19	 I  was  concerned  with  the  garden  hose  holding  up  to  very  hot  wash  drain  water  , 
16_kitchen_pos_20	 but  so  far  its  been  okay  . 
16_kitchen_pos_21	 -LRB-  If  I  was  installing  this  anyplace  else  or  using  this  in  my  home  , 
16_kitchen_pos_22	 I  might  not  be  so  nonchalant  .  -RRB- 
16_kitchen_pos_23	 My  unit  was  used  ,  from  an  area 
16_kitchen_pos_24	 where  there  was  very  hard  water  , 
16_kitchen_pos_25	 and  the  previous  owners  had  never  cleaned  the  innards  of  the  machine  . 
16_kitchen_pos_26	 I  soaked  everything  in  CLR  to  remove  the  scale  from  the  sump  grill  ,  the  heating  element  and  the  wash  arm  , 
16_kitchen_pos_27	 and  cleaned  the  gunk  out  from  under  the  door  seal  , 
16_kitchen_pos_28	 and  away  we  went  . 
16_kitchen_pos_29	 Since  we  are  in  an  office  , 
16_kitchen_pos_30	 we  always  use  the  Sanitary  wash  to  keep  the  cooties  down  . 
16_kitchen_pos_31	 The  machine  does  an  excellent  job  of  getting  even  cold  tapwater  super  hot  , 
16_kitchen_pos_32	 and  the  dishes  will  flash  dry 
16_kitchen_pos_33	 after  the  cycle  is  over  , 
16_kitchen_pos_34	 if  you  pop  the  door  open  . 
16_kitchen_pos_35	 The  machine  has  no  problem  pumping  wastewater  through  the  drain  line 
16_kitchen_pos_36	 and  up  3  feet  into  the  sink  . 
16_kitchen_pos_37	 One  reason  I  avoided  the  plastic  tub  Haier  is  noise  . 
16_kitchen_pos_38	 If  you  load  this  machine  carefully  , 
16_kitchen_pos_39	 you  can  prevent  items  from  clinking  against  each  other  too  much  , 
16_kitchen_pos_40	 and  the  machine  will  operate  more  quietly  . 
16_kitchen_pos_41	 We  `  ve  found 
16_kitchen_pos_42	 that  we  can  run  the  machine  ,  have  the  office  radio  on  ,  and  still  comfortably  make  phone  calls  without  much  trouble  . 
16_kitchen_pos_43	 My  only  complaints  would  be  that  on  occasion  , 
16_kitchen_pos_44	 the  timer  has  gotten  stuck 
16_kitchen_pos_45	 -LRB-  once  or  twice  in  100  washes  -RRB-  . 
16_kitchen_pos_46	 Also  ,  some  plastic  items  have  been  slightly  warped  by  the  heater  . 
16_kitchen_pos_47	 Capacity  is  very  decent  ,  probably 
16_kitchen_pos_48	 because  the  machine  is  pretty  large  . 
16_kitchen_pos_49	 Measure  first 
17_kitchen_pos_1	 Ok  let 
17_kitchen_pos_2	 me  start  by  saying 
17_kitchen_pos_3	 I  am  not  a  coffee  snob  , 
17_kitchen_pos_4	 I  am  more  of  a  coffee  nut  , 
17_kitchen_pos_5	 I  very  much  prefer  a  cup  of  my  nice  dark  italian  roast 
17_kitchen_pos_6	 but  if  the  neighbor  offers  me  a  cup  of  his  foldgers 
17_kitchen_pos_7	 I  wont  turn  up  my  nose  . 
17_kitchen_pos_8	 And  for  a  guy  like  me  this  machine  is  perfect  !  ! 
17_kitchen_pos_9	 I  looked  at  the  500  dollar  machines 
17_kitchen_pos_10	 but  just  couldnt  see 
17_kitchen_pos_11	spending
17_kitchen_pos_12	 that  for  something  I  see  myself  using  4-5  days  out  of  the  week  so  I  setteled  on  this  machine 
17_kitchen_pos_13	 and  I  have  not  one  regret  . 
17_kitchen_pos_14	 I  have  had  the  machine  about  3  weeks  now  , 
17_kitchen_pos_15	 I  admit  I  dont  use  it  every  day  as  I  have  thoses  mornings 
17_kitchen_pos_16	 where  I  am  just  running  late 
17_kitchen_pos_17	 and  dont  have  time  , 
17_kitchen_pos_18	 but  in  that  three  weeks  I  have  used  it  at  least  5  days  out  of  every  week 
17_kitchen_pos_19	 and  it  has  been  great  . 
17_kitchen_pos_20	 This  thing  is  so  easy  to  use  right  out  of  the  box  with  the  pods  I  was  just  amased  , 
17_kitchen_pos_21	 my  old  machine  went  down  quite 
17_kitchen_pos_22	 a  while  ago  so  I  havent  pulled  a  shot  in  a  very  long  time  and  with  this  machine 
17_kitchen_pos_23	 I  was  sipping  a  great  one  in  minutes  ! 
17_kitchen_pos_24	 The  one  thing 
17_kitchen_pos_25	 that  did  dissapoint 
17_kitchen_pos_26	 me  is  the  pods  , 
17_kitchen_pos_27	 I  bought  the  machine 
17_kitchen_pos_28	 thinking  I  would  use  them 
17_kitchen_pos_29	 as  they  seemed  so  convient  .  .  . 
17_kitchen_pos_30	 and  dont  get 
17_kitchen_pos_31	 me  wrong  , 
17_kitchen_pos_32	 the  illy  dark  roast  pods  make  one  of  the  best  shots  of  espresso 
17_kitchen_pos_33	 I  have  ever  had  ,  very  quickly  , 
17_kitchen_pos_34	 but  keep  in  mind 
17_kitchen_pos_35	 they  only  make  one  shot  at  a  time  so  for  me 
17_kitchen_pos_36	 who  usually  likes  3  or  4  shots  in  a  cappucino 
17_kitchen_pos_37	 they  are  a  bit  time  consuming 
17_kitchen_pos_38	 and  I  have  found  it  better 
17_kitchen_pos_39	 to  just  pack  my  own  double  shots  . 
17_kitchen_pos_40	 But  besides  that  little  thing 
17_kitchen_pos_41	 this  machine  is  perfect  for  a  coffee  nut  like  me  , 
17_kitchen_pos_42	 it  does  a  great  job  no  matter 
17_kitchen_pos_43	 what  im  in  the  mood  for  ,  be  it  a  straight  shot  ,  a  cappucino  ,  or  the  nice  mocha  latte  every  now 
17_kitchen_pos_44	 and  then  this  is  a  great  machine  for  you  , 
17_kitchen_pos_45	 may  not  be  good  enough  for  a  coffee  snob  .  .  . 
17_kitchen_pos_46	 but  just  right  for  a  coffee  nut  ! 
17_kitchen_pos_47	 Oh  and  one  hint  I  found  very  helpfull  .  .  . 
17_kitchen_pos_48	 turn  the  machine  on  5  or  10  minutes 
17_kitchen_pos_49	 before  you  are  going  to  use  it  -LRB-  the  longer  the  better  -RRB- 
17_kitchen_pos_50	 with  your  cups  up  on  the  warmer  . 
17_kitchen_pos_51	 I  saw  some  people  complaining  that  the  espresso  was  only  luke  warm 
17_kitchen_pos_52	 when  it  came  out  , 
17_kitchen_pos_53	 I  exprenced  the  same  problem 
17_kitchen_pos_54	 when  I  dont  let  it  warm  up 
17_kitchen_pos_55	 and  brew  into  a  cold  cup  ,  but  if  you  do  let  it  warm  up  it  will  make 
17_kitchen_pos_56	 you  a  nice 
17_kitchen_pos_57	 piping  hot  espresso  !
