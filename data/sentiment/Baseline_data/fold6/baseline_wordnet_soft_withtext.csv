 18_kitchen_pos_4	negative	0.75	0.5625	I  should  have  tried  harder  to  find  a  Pampered  Chef  rep  to  buy  another  one  ,  the  Pampered  Chef  one  works  better  than  this  one  . 
 18_kitchen_pos_5	positive	0.5	0.125	However  , 
 18_kitchen_pos_6	positive	0.375	0.25	this  is  not  a  horrible  product  . 
 18_kitchen_pos_7	negative	0.125	0.3125	One  drawback  compared  to  the  Pampered  Chef  one  is  that  you  ca  n't  see  through  this  one  to  see

 18_kitchen_pos_10	positive	0.0001	0.0001	and 
 18_kitchen_pos_11	negative	0.2916666666666667	0.25	when  it  is  less  than  1\/3  full  you  need 
 18_kitchen_pos_12	negative	0.0001	0.375	to  fill  it  back  up  or  it  wo  n't  work  as  well  . 
 18_kitchen_pos_13	negative	0.1875	0.1875	This  unit  is  even  more  finicky  than  the  Pampered  Chef  one  about  the  level  , 
 18_kitchen_pos_14	negative	0.21875	0.1875	it  almost  wo  n't  spray  if  the  level  is  too  low  . 
 18_kitchen_pos_15	negative	0.0001	0.0001	But  since  you  ca  n't  see  through  it  , 
 18_kitchen_pos_16	negative	0.0001	0.125	even  holding  it  up  to  the  light  , 
 18_kitchen_pos_17	negative	0.25	0.25	you  have  to  look  down  in  and  estimate 
 18_kitchen_pos_18	negative	0.1875	0.1875	how  high  it  is  . 
 18_kitchen_pos_19	negative	0.1875	0.25	The  reflective  coating  inside  makes  it  very  hard  to  see 
 18_kitchen_pos_20	negative	0.1875	0.3333333333333333	how  high  it  really  is  . 
 18_kitchen_pos_21	negative	0.0001	0.25	You  do  n't  want  to  fill  it  all  the  way  up  ,  either  . 
 18_kitchen_pos_22	negative	0.0001	0.0001	Then  , 
 18_kitchen_pos_23	positive	0.25	0.25	you  need 
 18_kitchen_pos_24	negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  pump  it  more 
 18_kitchen_pos_25	negative	0.1875	0.25	than  the  Pampered  Chef  one  needed  to  be  pumped  . 
 18_kitchen_pos_26	positive	0.1875	0.25	This  one  sprays  a  very  fine  spray  ,  finer  than  the  Pampered  Chef  one  . 
 18_kitchen_pos_27	positive	0.3333333333333333	0.25	And  it  sprays  quite  nicely  if  you  have  the  correct  level  of  oil  in  there  . 
 18_kitchen_pos_28	positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  think

 18_kitchen_pos_33	positive	0.0001	0.0001	before  I  put  it  away  ,

 18_kitchen_pos_36	positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  think 
 18_kitchen_pos_37	positive	0.125	0.375	if  you  leave  it  pressured  up  all  the  time  , 
 18_kitchen_pos_38	positive	0.0001	0.375	like  I  did  with  my  old  one  , 
 18_kitchen_pos_39	positive	0.75	0.0001	it  damages  the  nozzle  over  time  .

 18_kitchen_pos_41	negative	0.125	0.0001	Another  tip  --  do  n't  fill  it  with  anything  but  olive  oil  .

 18_kitchen_pos_43	negative	0.125	0.125	and  leave  a  sticky\/greasy  feeling  on  the  outside  of  the  sprayer  . 
 18_kitchen_pos_44	positive	0.0001	0.0001	You  know

 18_kitchen_pos_46	positive	0.125	0.125	you  get  that  greasy  feeling  on  things  that  you  leave  near  the  stove  or  that  hang  over  it  . 
 18_kitchen_pos_47	positive	0.125	0.0001	Olive  oil  does  n't  do  that  , 
 18_kitchen_pos_48	positive	0.0001	0.0001	that  's  why  I  now  do  n't  use  anything  else  on  my  stovetop 
 18_kitchen_pos_49	positive	0.375	0.0001	-LRB-  except  sometimes  peanut  oil  for  stir  frying  -RRB-  . 
 18_kitchen_pos_50	positive	0.125	0.875	This  type  of  sprayer  will  work  much  better  if  you  just  use  Olive  Oil  in  it  ,  trust  me  . 
 18_kitchen_pos_51	negative	0.0001	0.4375	But  if  you  have  a  choice  ,  go  find  a  Pampered  Chef  rep  and  by  their  sprayer  . 
 18_kitchen_pos_52	negative	0.25	0.625	It  's  cheaper  and  better  quality 
 12_kitchen_neg_1	positive	0.25	0.2916666666666667	I  `  ve  bought  a  number  of  Oxo  kitchen  accessories  ,  and  found  them  to  be  sturdy  ,  remarkably  well  designed  , 
 12_kitchen_neg_2	positive	0.25	0.625	and  easy  to  use  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_3	negative	0.5	0.25	Unfortunately  ,  this  timer  is  an  exception  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_4	positive	0.0001	0.16666666666666666	It  has  the  usual  features  typical  of  timers  at  this  price  point  : 
 12_kitchen_neg_5	positive	0.375	0.0001	clock  plus  timer  ,  ten  number  keys  for  input  ,  memory  ,  etc  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_6	positive	0.1875	0.25	But  instead  of  being  flat  with  a  magnet  on  the  back 
 12_kitchen_neg_7	positive	0.625	0.125	so  it  can  fall  off  the  refrigerator  like  other  timers  , 
 12_kitchen_neg_8	positive	0.0001	0.0001	it  's  round  like  a  traditional  wind-up  kitchen  timer  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_9	positive	0.0001	0.0001	It  's  solid-feeling 
 12_kitchen_neg_10	positive	0.125	0.5625	and  has  nice  non-skid  feet  on  the  bottom  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_11	negative	0.375	0.25	The  problem  is  the  display  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_12	negative	0.0001	0.0001	It  's  horrible  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_13	negative	0.0001	0.0001	For  three  reasons  : 
 12_kitchen_neg_14	negative	0.375	0.25	First  ,  the  numbers  are  small  --  smaller  than  any  other  timer 
 12_kitchen_neg_15	negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  `  ve  seen  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_16	negative	0.25	0.125	"They  `  re  about  1\/4  ""  high  , "
 12_kitchen_neg_17	negative	0.4375	0.3125	half  or  less  the  size  of  those  on  comparable  timers  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_18	negative	0.375	0.375	"Second  ,  the  numbers  are  recessed  1\/8  ""  or  more  beneath  a  clear  plastic  cover  ,  not  on  the  surface "
 12_kitchen_neg_19	negative	0.125	0.20833333333333334	--  it  's  dark  in  there  and  feels  like  looking  down  a  well  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_20	negative	0.1875	0.1875	It  desperately  needs  a  backlight  , 
 12_kitchen_neg_21	negative	0.125	0.25	but  there  is  none  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_22	negative	0.1875	0.3125	Unless  the  light  source  is  shining  directly  into  the  display  , 
 12_kitchen_neg_23	negative	0.3125	0.1875	there  's  a  large  dark  shadow 
 12_kitchen_neg_24	negative	0.0001	0.0001	covering  part  of  the  numbers  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_25	negative	0.625	0.0001	But  that  causes  the  third  problem  : 
 12_kitchen_neg_26	negative	0.125	0.4375	The  clear  plastic  cover  over  the  numbers  is  both  curved  and  highly  reflective  , 
 12_kitchen_neg_27	negative	0.3333333333333333	0.16666666666666666	and  it  's  virtually  impossible  to  arrange  things  so  that  there  is  n't  a  reflection 
 12_kitchen_neg_28	negative	0.25	0.4375	shining  back  into  your  eyes  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_29	negative	0.125	0.20833333333333334	The  bottom  line  is  that  I  have  to  fiddle  around  to  get  the  timer  ,  the  light  source  ,  and  myself  into  a  position 
 12_kitchen_neg_30	negative	0.25	0.125	where  I  can  read  the  small  ,  dark  ,  shadowed  , 
 12_kitchen_neg_31	negative	0.0001	0.375	and  reflective  display  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_32	negative	0.4375	0.25	Not  what  I  need 
 12_kitchen_neg_33	negative	0.0001	0.0001	when  I  'm  trying  to  cook  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_34	negative	0.625	0.0001	It  's  just  not  worth  it  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_35	negative	0.625	0.25	Since  I  have  several  other  timers  with  displays 
 12_kitchen_neg_36	negative	0.25	0.25	I  do  n't  have  to  strain  to  read  , 
 12_kitchen_neg_37	negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  use  this  one  as  a  paperweight  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_38	positive	0.0001	0.25	I  'd  have  to  say 
 12_kitchen_neg_39	positive	0.25	0.3125	it  works  very  well  . 
 12_kitchen_neg_40	negative	0.0001	0.375	I  just  do  n't  understand 
 12_kitchen_neg_41	negative	0.0001	0.125	how  Oxo  managed  to  let  such  a  flawed  design  out  the  door
