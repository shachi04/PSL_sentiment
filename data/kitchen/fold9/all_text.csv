9_kitchen_pos_1	Like many people ,
9_kitchen_pos_2	I have ignorant neighbors that allow their yappy mutt
9_kitchen_pos_3	to bark on
9_kitchen_pos_4	and on and on .
9_kitchen_pos_5	Despite talking to the neighbor politely and such ,
9_kitchen_pos_6	they still have no concern for the noise pollution .
9_kitchen_pos_7	I was losing sleep , and the barking was getting so bad
9_kitchen_pos_8	that I even considered moving !
9_kitchen_pos_9	In desperation ,
9_kitchen_pos_10	we looked online for something to stop barking dogs .
9_kitchen_pos_11	We came across Viatek 's Super Bark Stop
9_kitchen_pos_12	and decided to risk the money .
9_kitchen_pos_13	WOW , talk about being worth the money !
9_kitchen_pos_14	My husband affixed the device on a piece of wood ,
9_kitchen_pos_15	and staked it about 5 feet high in our back yard .
9_kitchen_pos_16	It 's unsightly , yes ,
9_kitchen_pos_17	but we ` re the only ones
9_kitchen_pos_18	to really see it .
9_kitchen_pos_19	More importantly ,
9_kitchen_pos_20	it 's RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE BARKING MUTT .
9_kitchen_pos_21	The first time he tested it ,
9_kitchen_pos_22	he told me the dog about jumped out of its skin !
9_kitchen_pos_23	We laughed gleefully .
9_kitchen_pos_24	Could a good night 's sleep actually be on the horizon . . . ?
9_kitchen_pos_25	It 's been several days and Super Bark Stop has worked AMAZINGLY .
9_kitchen_pos_26	The dog will lie as far as it can away from the device . . .
9_kitchen_pos_27	when it usually lay in the middle of the neighbor 's yard .
9_kitchen_pos_28	If it starts to yelp a little ,
9_kitchen_pos_29	it stops almost immediately .
9_kitchen_pos_30	It 's as if it 's afraid to bark .
9_kitchen_pos_31	YAY !
9_kitchen_pos_32	You can select the volume , tone , and number of barks
9_kitchen_pos_33	to help eliminate false activation
9_kitchen_pos_34	-LRB- say , from talking or loud bird squawking -RRB- .
9_kitchen_pos_35	Audible and inaudible both work fine ,
9_kitchen_pos_36	but we now keep it on inaudible at the two bark setting .
9_kitchen_pos_37	The device is waterproof plastic
9_kitchen_pos_38	and you need 4 D batteries
9_kitchen_pos_39	-LRB- not included -RRB-
9_kitchen_pos_40	to operate it .
9_kitchen_pos_41	I am SO thankful
9_kitchen_pos_42	we found Super Bark Stop !
9_kitchen_pos_43	My nerves were really getting jangled
9_kitchen_pos_44	and I was dreading early mornings ,
9_kitchen_pos_45	when they put the mutt outside .
9_kitchen_pos_46	It 's amazing at how inconsiderate neighbors are ;
9_kitchen_pos_47	just because you may want a dog does n't mean I want saddled with its noise
9_kitchen_pos_48	while you neglect it !
9_kitchen_pos_49	P. S .
9_kitchen_pos_50	After using Bark Stop for 2 weeks -LRB- yes , it did work ! -RRB- ,
9_kitchen_pos_51	we noticed that the neighbors dog started to bark a bit more .
9_kitchen_pos_52	-LRB- Not as bad as before , though . -RRB-
9_kitchen_pos_53	We had it on silent ,
9_kitchen_pos_54	and realized
9_kitchen_pos_55	that it had stopped working .
9_kitchen_pos_56	Apparently ,
9_kitchen_pos_57	it 's not 100 % waterproof ,
9_kitchen_pos_58	despite the claims of the manufacturer .
9_kitchen_pos_59	The person
9_kitchen_pos_60	I bought it from said
9_kitchen_pos_61	"that "" once it 's opened , we find that it 's not 100 % waterproof "" ."
9_kitchen_pos_62	Well guess
9_kitchen_pos_63	what ?
9_kitchen_pos_64	You gotta open it to put the batteries in it !
9_kitchen_pos_65	Either buy a faux bird house
9_kitchen_pos_66	to protect Bark Stop or house it
9_kitchen_pos_67	where it wo n't get wet .
9_kitchen_pos_68	Otherwise , you may find yourself in the same position
9_kitchen_pos_69	we were in .
9_kitchen_pos_70	We got a refund , and fortunately for us ,
9_kitchen_pos_71	our neighbors got rid of their dog . . . so we did n't bother getting a new one
