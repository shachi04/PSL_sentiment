13_cell_pos_1	I 'm a long-running Virgin customer ,
13_cell_pos_2	but additionally I work as a developer in the mobile industry , and so I ` ve had experience
13_cell_pos_3	using literally scores of handsets from every imaginable carrier
13_cell_pos_4	-LRB- including non-US -RRB- .
13_cell_pos_5	Previous Virgin phones I ` ve used include the Vox 8610
13_cell_pos_6	and Kyocera 2255 .
13_cell_pos_7	My 8610 still works ,
13_cell_pos_8	but it 's a bit bulky and heavy for my tastes
13_cell_pos_9	and I decided
13_cell_pos_10	to upgrade .
13_cell_pos_11	Let 's start with the positives :
13_cell_pos_12	- Very compact design .
13_cell_pos_13	This is probably the cheapest phone of its size\/capabilities available anywhere .
13_cell_pos_14	It is so thin
13_cell_pos_15	that
13_cell_pos_16	when I put it in the same pocket as my wallet ,
13_cell_pos_17	I sometimes forget
13_cell_pos_18	it 's there .
13_cell_pos_19	- For the cost ,
13_cell_pos_20	it is pretty decent in terms of features .
13_cell_pos_21	128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support , 10 MB for downloads
13_cell_pos_22	-LRB- 32 total -RRB- , speakerphone , web capability , comparable performance
13_cell_pos_23	to most Nokia series 40 devices .
13_cell_pos_24	Very long battery life ,
13_cell_pos_25	and fast
13_cell_pos_26	charging .
13_cell_pos_27	For those
13_cell_pos_28	that have had trouble with the battery
13_cell_pos_29	I suggest
13_cell_pos_30	you try turning off the backlight .
13_cell_pos_31	It might have . . . interesting . . . effects .
13_cell_pos_32	- Uses the Sprint network .
13_cell_pos_33	I ` ve found this to be very reliable in my area ,
13_cell_pos_34	and signal quality is excellent both in and outdoors .
13_cell_pos_35	- Call quality is good .
13_cell_pos_36	Comparable to the 8610 as far as I can tell ,
13_cell_pos_37	which was also good
13_cell_pos_38	-LRB- my old Kyocera , on the other hand , was garbage -RRB- .
13_cell_pos_39	- UI has a solid , standard design .
13_cell_pos_40	Predictive text included for messaging .
13_cell_pos_41	The phone 's graphics are a bit odd ,
13_cell_pos_42	but not necessarily in a bad ways .
13_cell_pos_43	- Durable .
13_cell_pos_44	UTStarcom knows
13_cell_pos_45	how to build to last .
13_cell_pos_46	This handset is no exception .
13_cell_pos_47	- Good library of games , ringtones , and graphics available .
13_cell_pos_48	Now I actually have something to spend all that balance on . . .
13_cell_pos_49	- Virgin is a very low cost provider .
13_cell_pos_50	It 's no good if you want video on demand , 3G , or whatnot .
13_cell_pos_51	But for just making calls\/texting now and then ,
13_cell_pos_52	you simply ca n't beat $ 20\/3 months .
13_cell_pos_53	No annual contract as well ,
13_cell_pos_54	which is a huge plus
13_cell_pos_55	-LRB- as many who ` ve had one know all too well -RRB- .
13_cell_pos_56	On the downside :
13_cell_pos_57	- Keys are a bit small .
13_cell_pos_58	This is typical of ultra-thin handsets .
13_cell_pos_59	They are a bit stiff as well ,
13_cell_pos_60	which is good and bad
13_cell_pos_61	-LRB- good
13_cell_pos_62	because you wo n't accidentally press them as easily , bad
13_cell_pos_63	because typing is more of a pain -RRB- .
13_cell_pos_64	- Virgin 's web browser is lame .
13_cell_pos_65	Their web service costs extra ,
13_cell_pos_66	and it has problems viewing many page formats
13_cell_pos_67	-LRB- says ' network gremlins '
13_cell_pos_68	when you try . . .
13_cell_pos_69	cute -RRB- .
13_cell_pos_70	You can browse basic html ,
13_cell_pos_71	and that 's about it - good luck reading e-mail with it .
13_cell_pos_72	- No bluetooth built-in ,
13_cell_pos_73	though this is to be expected .
13_cell_pos_74	- No camera either , also to be expected .
13_cell_pos_75	This can actually be a good thing ,
13_cell_pos_76	since camera phones are off-limits
13_cell_pos_77	in more areas than you might expect .
13_cell_pos_78	Bottom line :
13_cell_pos_79	this handset is great for the price .
13_cell_pos_80	There are flaws with it , as with any phone ,
13_cell_pos_81	but the pluses outweigh the minuses .
13_cell_pos_82	I ` ve seen many reviewers complain about both Virgin and the phone ,
13_cell_pos_83	but in my professional opinion
13_cell_pos_84	-LRB- and it is an expert opinion -RRB-
13_cell_pos_85	these people need
13_cell_pos_86	to realize
13_cell_pos_87	that you get
13_cell_pos_88	what you pay for .
13_cell_pos_89	This is n't a $ 200 Samsung T519 ,
13_cell_pos_90	and you ` re not paying $ 60 a month for service on a 2 year contract .
13_cell_pos_91	Considering the costs , the Slice is an great handset with excellent service ,
13_cell_pos_92	and that is that
