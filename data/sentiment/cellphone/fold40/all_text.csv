20_cell_neg_1	After reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone ,
20_cell_neg_2	I purchased .
20_cell_neg_3	Here are the main issues I have found with this phone :
20_cell_neg_4	1 -RRB- The buttons are too small ,
20_cell_neg_5	particularly the main control button .
20_cell_neg_6	You have to used the side of your fingers
20_cell_neg_7	to ensure
20_cell_neg_8	that you do not hit too buttons at the same time .
20_cell_neg_9	And , believe
20_cell_neg_10	me ,
20_cell_neg_11	I do not have very large hands .
20_cell_neg_12	2 -RRB- If you have quite a few contacts in your phone ,
20_cell_neg_13	you will be irritated by the delay
20_cell_neg_14	when you scroll down quickly to select a contact .
20_cell_neg_15	You will notice that if you are not careful ,
20_cell_neg_16	you will dial the wrong contact due
20_cell_neg_17	to the delay
20_cell_neg_18	when scrolling and selecting quickly , so if this is you , be aware .
20_cell_neg_19	3 -RRB- You
20_cell_neg_20	must open the cover
20_cell_neg_21	and look inside to see if you have missed a call or have a message .
20_cell_neg_22	VERY INCONVENIENT ! !
20_cell_neg_23	There is no indication to show this on the top screen , only the inside screen .
20_cell_neg_24	4 -RRB- On occasion , the display on the outside of the phone stops
20_cell_neg_25	working entirely .
20_cell_neg_26	What you just need to do is power the phone down
20_cell_neg_27	and they back up again .
20_cell_neg_28	Not optimal ,
20_cell_neg_29	and I probably just got a bad phone ,
20_cell_neg_30	but I am just waiting for the situation to get more frequent ,
20_cell_neg_31	so I can then deal with the likely nightmare of having to get a replacement phone from Motorola .
20_cell_neg_32	NOTE :
20_cell_neg_33	I have no personal vendetta against Motorola ,
20_cell_neg_34	but wanted to provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff
20_cell_neg_35	I bought into before purchasing
