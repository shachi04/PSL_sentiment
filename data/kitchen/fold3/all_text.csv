3_kitchen_pos_1	I ` ve lusted after a Super Auto for years .
3_kitchen_pos_2	When I finally decided to get one ,
3_kitchen_pos_3	I did a fare amount of investigating .
3_kitchen_pos_4	The Gaggia Titanium had the best spec 's for the price and good reviews .
3_kitchen_pos_5	I decided to spend the extra money for the Stainless unit .
3_kitchen_pos_6	I have n't seen the painted plastic model
3_kitchen_pos_7	so I ca n't comment on the appearance .
3_kitchen_pos_8	I do think
3_kitchen_pos_9	the Stainless looks great !
3_kitchen_pos_10	You can find reviews of the non-stainless here on Amazon and other than the outside appearance , the device is the same .
3_kitchen_pos_11	I ` ve only had the unit for a few days
3_kitchen_pos_12	but so far ,
3_kitchen_pos_13	I 'm very happy .
3_kitchen_pos_14	To the negatives first .
3_kitchen_pos_15	The manual is awful !
3_kitchen_pos_16	It 's not just the Italian to English translation !
3_kitchen_pos_17	The text is skimpy and the illustrations not so great .
3_kitchen_pos_18	I spent
3_kitchen_pos_19	a fair amount of time making sure
3_kitchen_pos_20	I understood
3_kitchen_pos_21	how to setup and use the unit .
3_kitchen_pos_22	I 'm pretty technically savvy and in the end ,
3_kitchen_pos_23	I figured it all out .
3_kitchen_pos_24	But do n't rush into using this product
3_kitchen_pos_25	until you ` ve figured out
3_kitchen_pos_26	how to set it up , clean it
3_kitchen_pos_27	and adjust all the settings
3_kitchen_pos_28	-LRB- there are many -RRB- .
3_kitchen_pos_29	The only issue I ` ve had is whereby the auto bean grinder thinks
3_kitchen_pos_30	it 's empty
3_kitchen_pos_31	when it 's not .
3_kitchen_pos_32	Open the lid
3_kitchen_pos_33	-LRB-
3_kitchen_pos_34	which could be a bit better designed -RRB-
3_kitchen_pos_35	and stir and
3_kitchen_pos_36	it works .
3_kitchen_pos_37	Could be the beans
3_kitchen_pos_38	I 'm using not sure .
3_kitchen_pos_39	It 's an intermittent issue .
3_kitchen_pos_40	The good stuff :
3_kitchen_pos_41	once you figure out the coffee strength and grind , the Gaggia makes a delicious cup .
3_kitchen_pos_42	I wish
3_kitchen_pos_43	the brew were a tad hotter
3_kitchen_pos_44	-LRB- I have it set to max -RRB-
3_kitchen_pos_45	but using the cup warmer helps .
3_kitchen_pos_46	No issues making froth with the wand ;
3_kitchen_pos_47	much better than the older manual machine
3_kitchen_pos_48	I had .
3_kitchen_pos_49	You ca n't put a huge mug under the unit
3_kitchen_pos_50	-LRB- the max size is 4.5 inches -RRB-
3_kitchen_pos_51	but its so easy to make a cup you just make fresh
3_kitchen_pos_52	when needed .
3_kitchen_pos_53	You can set the unit for the amount of brew .
3_kitchen_pos_54	However ,
3_kitchen_pos_55	"I found that clicking the "" large coffee "" button twice , the unit thinks"
3_kitchen_pos_56	it 's making 2 cups
3_kitchen_pos_57	and that just about fills a decent size mug .
3_kitchen_pos_58	It 's much stronger too since the unit grinds two doses of coffee instead of just adding more hot water
3_kitchen_pos_59	using the programmable size .
3_kitchen_pos_60	You get a nice foam on top
3_kitchen_pos_61	and as I said ,
3_kitchen_pos_62	the coffee is outstanding .
3_kitchen_pos_63	I love the clean up
3_kitchen_pos_64	-LRB- or lack of -RRB-
3_kitchen_pos_65	compared to the drip maker I had -LRB- a Bodum Vacuum unit -RRB- .
3_kitchen_pos_66	I still have that unit
3_kitchen_pos_67	should I need to make a lot of coffee for company .
3_kitchen_pos_68	But for the two mugs
3_kitchen_pos_69	I drink in the morning ,
3_kitchen_pos_70	the Gaggia easily replaces this unit .
3_kitchen_pos_71	And there 's far less cleanup .
3_kitchen_pos_72	The grinds sit in a canister
3_kitchen_pos_73	and after a few days ,
3_kitchen_pos_74	you just tap it out into the trash
3_kitchen_pos_75	and maybe rinse .
3_kitchen_pos_76	So ,
3_kitchen_pos_77	you can use this Gaggia to replace a conventional coffee machine as long as you ` re making a cup or two .
3_kitchen_pos_78	What I love is just pressing a button twice
3_kitchen_pos_79	-LRB- for two large coffees -RRB-
3_kitchen_pos_80	and walking away from the unit .
3_kitchen_pos_81	A minute later , a great cup of Joe .
3_kitchen_pos_82	It truly is super automatic .
3_kitchen_pos_83	I have the unit
3_kitchen_pos_84	set for Energy savor
3_kitchen_pos_85	whereby it 's in a kind of sleep mode a few hours after I use it .
3_kitchen_pos_86	I only drink in the morning .
3_kitchen_pos_87	However ,
3_kitchen_pos_88	"if you decide to "" wake it up "" ,"
3_kitchen_pos_89	it heats up in about 2 minutes .
3_kitchen_pos_90	It also does a rinse cycle
3_kitchen_pos_91	so I keep a small glass under the unit so it can clean itself
3_kitchen_pos_92	and rinse out about 3oz of water .
3_kitchen_pos_93	There is a little pan
3_kitchen_pos_94	under which would catch the water
3_kitchen_pos_95	but then you have to toss it out ever few days .
3_kitchen_pos_96	"There 's also a "" full Rinse "" cycle"
3_kitchen_pos_97	that thoroughly cleans out the unit
3_kitchen_pos_98	and uses about half the water in the reservoir .
3_kitchen_pos_99	It 's a menu item
3_kitchen_pos_100	so do n't select it
3_kitchen_pos_101	unless you really want to do this
3_kitchen_pos_102	-LRB- takes about 5 minutes and a lot of water goes into the catch pan or several cups if you so desire -RRB- .
3_kitchen_pos_103	Yes it cost big bucks
3_kitchen_pos_104	but as long as it works well for years
3_kitchen_pos_105	and keeps its great looks ,
3_kitchen_pos_106	I 'm very happy .
3_kitchen_pos_107	UPDATE .
3_kitchen_pos_108	The issue with the grinder was the beans
3_kitchen_pos_109	-LRB- too oily -RRB- .
3_kitchen_pos_110	I called the NY office
3_kitchen_pos_111	"and got someone in "" tech support """
3_kitchen_pos_112	in minutes .
3_kitchen_pos_113	She knew
3_kitchen_pos_114	her product .
3_kitchen_pos_115	Sure enough , the inside of the grinder area was super oily
3_kitchen_pos_116	making it hard for the beans
3_kitchen_pos_117	to fall into the grinder area .
