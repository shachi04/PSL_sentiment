negative	0.1875	0.1875	Again  ,  should  be  pretty  basic  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	but  no  go  .

negative	0.5625	0.25	Not  sure  why  ,

negative	0.125	0.0001	I  'm  going  to  still  keep  it  at  4  stars

positive	0.3333333333333333	0.2916666666666667	since  I  have  a  very  old  sink  and  the  only  other  connection 
positive	0.125	0.25	I  had  was  to  cold  water  lines  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	Also  ,  the  machine  is  on  the  floor  ,

positive	0.0001	0.5	Luckily  ,

positive	0.1875	0.25	I  was  concerned  with  the  garden  hose  holding  up  to  very  hot  wash  drain  water  ,

positive	0.125	0.25	My  unit  was  used  ,  from  an  area

positive	0.375	0.25	and  the  previous  owners  had  never  cleaned  the  innards  of  the  machine  . 
positive	0.25	0.0001	I  soaked  everything  in  CLR  to  remove  the  scale  from  the  sump  grill  ,  the  heating  element  and  the  wash  arm  ,

positive	0.125	0.25	One  reason  I  avoided  the  plastic  tub  Haier  is  noise  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	If  you  load  this  machine  carefully  , 
positive	0.4375	0.1875	you  can  prevent  items  from  clinking  against  each  other  too  much  , 
positive	0.375	0.0001	and  the  machine  will  operate  more  quietly  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	We  `  ve  found

positive	0.1875	0.375	Capacity  is  very  decent  ,  probably 
positive	0.16666666666666666	0.20833333333333331	because  the  machine  is  pretty  large  .

negative	0.0001	0.25	I  do  n't  want  this

negative	0.125	0.1875	-LRB-  I  guess  what  it  does  is  it  starts  fluctuating  power  from  the  wall  ,  like  switching  off  , 
negative	0.125	0.25	when  the  battery  is  fully  charged  .  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	so  it  beeps  as  if  it  's  being  plugged  in  over

negative	0.0001	0.125	When  I  first  got  it  , 
negative	0.4166666666666667	0.20833333333333331	I  was  trying  to  carefully  plug  it  into  my  phone  --  and  I  did  n't  want  to  damage  the  little  metal  things  inside  my  phone  OR  on  the  charger  . 
negative	0.125	0.1875	It  was  n't  going  in  smoothly 
negative	0.0001	0.375	and  it  did  n't  match  up 
negative	0.0001	0.75	or  seem  to  fit  inside  at  ALL  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	So  I  went  a  day  without  a  phone 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  I  did  more  research  to  see 
negative	0.0001	0.75	why  the  heck  they  'd  lie  that  it  fit  my  phone  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	Finally  I  got

positive	0.125	0.25	But  it  was  charging

positive	0.125	0.25	-LRB-  my  cell  is  my  only  phone  .  . 
positive	0.125	0.1875	so  I  was  cut  off  from  the  world  -RRB-  .

negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  could  n't  figure  it  out  ! 
negative	0.0001	0.25	I  had  to  jimmy  it  off  ,

positive	0.125	0.20833333333333331	I  was  able  to  put  it  back  on  ,  and  finally  learned  a  routine  so  to  speak  ,  for  taking  it  off  ,

negative	0.25	0.25	It  's  very  cheap  . 
positive	0.0001	0.125	So  ,  the  charger  works  ,

positive	0.375	0.125	to  expose  the  number  keys  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	The  only  things  that  I  can  think  of  thus  far

positive	0.625	0.375	that  's  not  in  your  contacts  and  to  text  message  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Next  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	we  go  to  the  features  .

positive	0.5	0.125	However  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	once  you  play  it  ,

negative	0.0001	0.625	Plus  , 
negative	0.375	0.125	it  only  allows  for  20  seconds  of  recording  time  regardless  of  the  size  of  your  microSD  card  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	3\/5 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	3  .  Music  Player  -  Impressive  .

negative	0.375	0.0001	I  still  could  not  find  a  way  to  change  the  order  of  the  songs  without  making  a  playlist  . 
positive	0.0001	0.125	There  's  play  ,  pause  ,  next  song  ,  previous  song  ,  fast  forward  ,  and  rewind  features

positive	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	The  buttons  must  be  pressed  fairly  hard  ,

positive	0.25	0.3125	Also  ,  I  was  blown  away  on  how  the  quality  of  the  music  improves

negative	0.0001	0.0001	as  it  serves  as  the  '  antenna  '  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	This  means  that  if  you  want  to  hear  the  radio  on  your  phone  , 
negative	0.25	0.25	you  NEED  to  have  the  earbuds  with  you  . 
negative	0.25	0.25	You  may  need  to  play  around  with  the  position  of  the  phone  and  antenna

positive	0.0001	0.25	I  have  had  the  machine  about  3  weeks  now  , 
positive	0.0001	0.1875	I  admit  I  dont  use  it  every  day  as  I  have  thoses  mornings

positive	0.125	0.25	and  it  has  been  great  . 
positive	0.16666666666666666	0.34375	This  thing  is  so  easy  to  use  right  out  of  the  box  with  the  pods  I  was  just  amased  , 
positive	0.625	0.375	my  old  machine  went  down  quite

negative	0.0001	0.125	but  keep  in  mind 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	they  only  make  one  shot  at  a  time  so  for  me 
negative	0.0001	0.125	who  usually  likes  3  or  4  shots  in  a  cappucino 
negative	0.125	0.25	they  are  a  bit  time  consuming

positive	0.25	0.25	Oh  and  one  hint  I  found  very  helpfull  .  .  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	turn  the  machine  on  5  or  10  minutes

negative	0.625	0.0001	I  exprenced  the  same  problem 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	when  I  dont  let  it  warm  up 
positive	0.75	0.25	and  brew  into  a  cold  cup  ,  but  if  you  do  let  it  warm  up  it  will  make

positive	0.125	0.125	piping  hot  espresso  ! 
positive	0.375	0.125	Well  after  reading  the  reviews  of  this  vacuum  , 
positive	0.125	0.0001	I  decided  to  give  it  a  try  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	I  have  had  it  a  month  now  and  I  have  to  say 
negative	0.375	0.25	that  I  am  sorry 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  bought  this  behemoth  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	Right  out  of  the  box 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  trying  it  for  the  first  time  I  noticed  things 
negative	0.0001	0.125	that  I  did  n't  like  . 
negative	0.125	0.125	I  thought  I  'd  give  it  some  time  though  and  hoped 
negative	0.0001	0.125	I  could  adjust  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	Here  is  what  I  found  : 
negative	0.25	0.25	1  .  The  vacuum  is  very  heavy 
negative	0.625	0.25	as  other  reviewers  have  stated  . 
negative	0.5	0.0001	2  .  Worse  than  the  vacuum 
negative	0.125	0.25	being  heavy  , 
negative	0.125	0.28125	the  darn  thing  is  really  hard  to  push  . 
negative	0.75	0.125	Even  on  hard  smooth  surfaces 
negative	0.75	0.0001	it  's  hard  to  push  . 
negative	0.625	0.21875	I  have  not  figured  out  yet  what  the  heck  would  cause  it  to  have  so  much  drag  . 
negative	0.5	0.0001	For  it  to  drag  on  hard  surfaces  , 
negative	0.125	0.25	it  must  be  a  design  flaw  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	3  .  The  on\/off  power  switch  is  foot 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	operated  . 
positive	0.625	0.0001	Not  a  terrible  thing 
negative	0.25	0.125	but  Dirt  Devil  decided  to  put  the  darn  thing  out  of  view 
negative	0.25	0.0001	and  hidden  by  the  accessory  carriage  . 
negative	0.125	0.125	On  my  first  time  of  vacuuming  I  accidentally  ran  over  a  sock 
negative	0.0001	0.125	and  it  got  caught  in  the  floor  brush  . 
negative	0.25	0.1875	While  the  brush  belt  was  smoking  I  fumbled  around  for  the  damn  power  switch  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	I  finally  had  to  reach  down 
negative	0.0001	0.5	and  press  the  switch  by  hand 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	because  I  could  n't  find  it  by  looking  down  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	It  must  have  taking  me  eight  to  ten  seconds  to  finally  turn  the  thing  off  . 
negative	0.375	0.25	Unfortunately  ,  the  damage  was  done  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	The  belt  snapped  . 
negative	0.0001	0.875	How  nice  . 
negative	0.0001	0.375	I  really  liked  that  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	First  time  out  and  the  belt  snapped  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Another  note  about  the  switch  ; 
negative	0.125	0.3333333333333333	there  have  been  times 
negative	0.0001	0.25	I  have  had  to  repeatedly  press  the  switch 
negative	0.625	0.0001	because  it  would  not  lock  off  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	It  takes  a  firm  steady  pressure 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  turn  it  off  . 
negative	0.125	0.3125	The  fun  part  of  this  annoyance  is  that  you  think 
negative	0.0001	0.25	you  have  it  turned  off 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	because  the  motor  starts  winding  down 
negative	0.125	0.0001	and  as  soon  as  you  let  up  on  it  the  motor  powers  up  . 
negative	0.25	0.28125	Couple  that  with  not  being  able  to  really  see  the  darn  thing 
negative	0.25	0.375	it  's  a  real  challenge  . 
negative	0.3125	0.2916666666666667	Maybe  Dirt  Devil  thinks  we  have  eyes  on  our  toes  . 
negative	0.25	0.16666666666666666	Hey  Dirt  Devil  here  is  an  idea  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	How  about  putting  the  on\/off  switch  on  the  push  handle  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	What  a  novel  idea  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Doh  ! 
negative	0.25	0.3333333333333333	4  .  The  vacuum  hose  that  detaches  is  really  unwieldy  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	It  has  a  long  plastic  handle 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	that  you  hold  onto  and 
negative	0.625	0.625	that  makes  it  really  difficult  to  manipulate  the  hose  . 
negative	0.16666666666666666	0.21875	The  main  reason  being  is  that  the  hose  it  too  short  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	It  's  like  you  are  fighting  the  hose  all  the  time  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	It  gets 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	tiring  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	5  . 
negative	0.125	0.3125	The  detachable  hose  is  really  hard  to  re-install  in  it  's  port  . 
negative	0.125	0.28125	You  have  to  wedge  it  in  there  really  hard  to  get  the  thing  to  seat  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	6  . 
negative	0.25	0.25	The  vacuum  is  terrible  on  rugs  ,  on  any  of  the  floor  height  settings  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	It  bunches  up  the  rugs 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  starts  smoking  baby  . 
positive	0.375	0.40625	My  old  vac  was  not  much  better 
negative	0.0001	0.375	but  at  least  with  the  old  one 
negative	0.25	0.125	I  could  lift  the  vac  and  kind  of  drag 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	it  over  the  rug 
negative	0.0001	0.125	and  it  would  n't  get  all 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	caught  up  . 
negative	0.375	0.125	I  tried  the  same  thing  with  the  Dirt  Devil 
negative	0.0001	0.25	and  forget  about  it  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	It  jammed  up  every  time  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	7  . 
negative	0.4166666666666667	0.1875	The  vacuum  is  poor  at  getting  dirt  off  of  hard  surface  floors  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	It  just  moves  the  dirt  around  or  spits  it  out  the  back  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	I  have  to  use  the  hose  attachment  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	8  . 
negative	0.25	0.25	The  vacuum  is  horrible  on  steps  . 
negative	0.0001	0.375	With  my  old  vac 
negative	0.25	0.25	I  could  drag  the  vac  across  each  step  whilst  the  vacuum  is  locked  in  the  upright  position  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Easy  deal  . 
negative	0.5	0.125	The  Dirt  Devil  does  not  work  that  way  . 
negative	0.225	0.3	When  the  vacuum  is  in  the  upright  position  the  brush  is  too  high  off  the  carpet  to  do  any  good  . 
negative	0.25	0.25	The  only  option  is  to  disengage  the  lock  and  vacuum  with  the  back  slanted  . 
negative	0.5	0.0001	One  little  problem  with  that  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	The  weight  of  the  vac  cause  the  seal  at  the  base  of  the  dirt  canister  to  open  and  air  begins  leaking  . 
negative	0.0001	0.5	You  do  n't  get  a  good  positive  suction  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	So  , 
negative	0.0001	0.1875	you  have  to  play  with  the  position  of  the  tilt  to  get  the  proper  seal  . 
negative	0.28125	0.25	The  problem  is  that  the  proper  position  you  need  is  so  close  to 
negative	0.375	0.0001	where  the  vacuum  locks  into  the  upright  position  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	It  often  locks  and  so  then  you  have  to  try  and  un-lock  it 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	while  balancing  this  heavy  behemoth  . 
negative	0.0001	0.375	It  's  a  joke  . 
negative	0.1875	0.375	The  only  half  easy  way  to  do  steps  is  if  use  the  detachable  hose 
negative	0.0001	0.125	and  attach  the  power  brush  . 
negative	0.3958333333333333	0.25	The  only  problem  with  that  is  you  are  fighting  the  ill  designed  hose  and  heavy  vacuum  ,  and  not  to  mention 
negative	0.0001	0.375	that  the  brush  attachment  will  only  really  get  surface  dirt  . 
negative	0.125	0.0001	If  you  try  putting  pressure  for  some  deep  cleaning  the  brush  stops  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Now  for  Pros  : 
positive	0.3333333333333333	0.25	1  .  The  vacuum  does  seem  to  get  the  carpets  pretty  clean  . 
positive	0.0001	0.5	It  has  good  suction 
positive	0.0001	0.25	and  it  raises  the  carpet  fibers  right  up  . 
positive	0.0001	0.375	It  almost  makes  my  carpet  look  like  new  , 
positive	0.625	0.0001	and  I  do  not  see  an  excessive  amount  of  carpet  fibers  in  the  dirt  canister  . 
positive	0.375	0.0001	Some  vacuums  like  to  just  tear  up  carpets  . 
positive	0.25	0.4375	2  .  The  rotating  brush  attachment  works  pretty  good  for  removing  cat  hair  off  of  couches  and  bedding  . 
negative	0.35	0.25	All  in  all  this  vacuum  was  very  very  poorly  designed  . 
negative	0.0001	0.4375	I  may  just  have  to  donate  this  thing 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  buy  something  else  . 
negative	0.5	0.0001	I  ca  n't  imagine  fighting  this  thing 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	every  week 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	for  years  to  come  or  until  the  motor  dies  . 
negative	0.125	0.5625	Maybe  I  `  ll  be  lucky 
negative	0.125	0.0001	and  the  motor  will  die  soon  . 
negative	0.125	0.125	Then  I  `  ll  just  throw  the  darn  thing  out 
negative	0.5	0.125	and  buy  something  other  than  Dirt  Devil  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Steve 
positive	0.125	0.5	Rings-Ding  's  are  the  best  snacks  out  there  for  many  a  reasons  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	First  off  , 
positive	0.125	0.5	they  are  the  best  after  dinner  snacks  out  there  . 
positive	0.625	0.375	It  's  really  like  a  cake  ,  just  more  condensed  and  not  as  fatty  or  filling  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	Also  ,  these  things  are  addicting  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	In  my  life  , 
positive	0.375	0.125	I  can  not  even  count  how  much  packs 
positive	0.0001	0.25	I  have  consumed  , 
positive	0.125	0.25	since  I  have  been  eating  these  things  everyday 
positive	0.125	0.25	since  I  was  young  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  let  's  just  say 
positive	0.1875	0.2916666666666667	now  I  am  very  old  . 
positive	0.625	0.0001	If  you  can  not  afford  drugs  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	then  go  for  the  ring-ding  's  . 
negative	0.5	0.1875	The  only  negative  about  these  things  if  there  is  n't  enough  cream  , 
negative	0.0001	0.125	then  you  get  a  mouthful  of  chocolate  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Most  people  I  know  like  the  chocolate  , 
negative	0.625	0.125	but  I  personally  would  not  like  a  mouthful  of  it  . 
negative	0.375	0.25	Another  bad  thing  is  in  the  summer  , 
negative	0.125	0.25	they  are  melted  and  can  only  be  slightly  revived  if  refrigerated  . 
negative	0.0001	0.75	They  kind  of  lose  that  good  flavor  edge  in  the  summer  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	which  makes  this  the  perfect  snack  for  the  winter  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Alright  .  .  .

positive	0.20833333333333331	0.1875	that  is  pretty  soft  . 
positive	0.1875	0.1875	In  the  center  is  a  creamy  sensation

positive	0.0001	0.0001	that 
positive	0.0001	0.6875	really  makes  this  product  go  from  good  to  great  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Put  that  together
