3_gourmet_neg_1	I must write quickly ,
3_gourmet_neg_2	for soon , soon , the Milk will awake within me again .
3_gourmet_neg_3	And it will know ,
3_gourmet_neg_4	but you will have been warned .
3_gourmet_neg_5	The Milk will punish me ,
3_gourmet_neg_6	but it knows
3_gourmet_neg_7	it must have a host ,
3_gourmet_neg_8	so I will survive -
3_gourmet_neg_9	tormented and trapped within myself ,
3_gourmet_neg_10	but I will continue to exist ,
3_gourmet_neg_11	though I live in nightmare now .
3_gourmet_neg_12	Beware !
3_gourmet_neg_13	Beware the Milk !
3_gourmet_neg_14	For the Milk lives .
3_gourmet_neg_15	I too was once tempted by the smooth , sweet creaminess of Tuscan Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 Fl Oz .
3_gourmet_neg_16	I too read the odes
3_gourmet_neg_17	written to its greatness ,
3_gourmet_neg_18	not knowing
3_gourmet_neg_19	that the Milk was forcing it 's hosts
3_gourmet_neg_20	to speak of the goodness of the Milk that the Milk might spread ,
3_gourmet_neg_21	that it might acquire new hosts in which to live ,
3_gourmet_neg_22	and to spread ,
3_gourmet_neg_23	to spread ,
3_gourmet_neg_24	to spread .
3_gourmet_neg_25	Beware the sweet seduction of the Milk !
3_gourmet_neg_26	Ah - the bittersweet memories
3_gourmet_neg_27	of that first gallon .
3_gourmet_neg_28	How smooth , how creamy , how exhilarating , uplifting , fulfilling and enlightening !
3_gourmet_neg_29	How free it made me feel !
3_gourmet_neg_30	But then came that terrible moment
3_gourmet_neg_31	when in my home town supermarket ,
3_gourmet_neg_32	I reached for a gallon of store brand milk ,
3_gourmet_neg_33	and felt the pain .
3_gourmet_neg_34	Oh , the pain the Milk can give !
3_gourmet_neg_35	Equal in intensity to the first joy that the Milk can give , but pain !
3_gourmet_neg_36	Terrible pain !
3_gourmet_neg_37	Words alone can not describe it !
3_gourmet_neg_38	And now ,
3_gourmet_neg_39	I live in fear of the Milk , a Slave to the joy
3_gourmet_neg_40	and the pain
3_gourmet_neg_41	it can give .
3_gourmet_neg_42	Oh , the shame
3_gourmet_neg_43	I feel
3_gourmet_neg_44	that I must come to the Milk like a supplicant ,
3_gourmet_neg_45	begging for the pleasure
3_gourmet_neg_46	it can give .
3_gourmet_neg_47	And the cowardice that I feel ,
3_gourmet_neg_48	knowing
3_gourmet_neg_49	that I can not face the pain it can inflict .
3_gourmet_neg_50	Beware !
3_gourmet_neg_51	Do not let this be your fate !
3_gourmet_neg_52	And now ,
3_gourmet_neg_53	I must go . . .
3_gourmet_neg_54	the Milk stirs inside me ,
3_gourmet_neg_55	and it will be angry .
3_gourmet_neg_56	But perhaps , perhaps ,
3_gourmet_neg_57	it is not too late for you . . .
