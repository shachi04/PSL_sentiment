13_kitchen_neg_1	We purchased this machine for our small coffee shop 2 months ago as in the discription
13_kitchen_neg_2	it was said
13_kitchen_neg_3	to be for light commercial use .
13_kitchen_neg_4	We make
13_kitchen_neg_5	probably 20-30 cups of coffee a day .
13_kitchen_neg_6	Our problems began the first week after receiving it .
13_kitchen_neg_7	The machine makes great froth for cappuccinoes
13_kitchen_neg_8	but if you want to have steamed milk instead of frothed it
13_kitchen_neg_9	either comes out of luke warm temperature allthough the setting is on high temperature or if you put the dial almost on the line between latte and cappuccino it gives you too much foam ,
13_kitchen_neg_10	which lattes should n't have .
13_kitchen_neg_11	So customers complain about their lattes
13_kitchen_neg_12	being either too cool or too foamy .
13_kitchen_neg_13	We called the manufacturer 's customer service
13_kitchen_neg_14	and were rudely brushed off .
13_kitchen_neg_15	For a small business like us it is hard to close for 2-3 weeks to send the machine for temperature adjustment service , so we had to deal with it .
13_kitchen_neg_16	Another problem came up 3-4 weeks later ,
13_kitchen_neg_17	when the machine started shutting off by itself in the middle of steaming\/frothing cycle or frother cleaning cycle .
13_kitchen_neg_18	Sometimes we had to restart it up to 5 times to make 1 cup of hot chocolate , just to steam milk .
13_kitchen_neg_19	At the customer service we were told to reset the computer by unplugging the machine for a couple of hours ,
13_kitchen_neg_20	which we did .
13_kitchen_neg_21	It did not shut off for 1 day !
13_kitchen_neg_22	The next day the problem started again . . .
13_kitchen_neg_23	I perform every neccessary cleaning or maintenance procedure that machine prompts and cappuccino cleaning daily , so you can not say
13_kitchen_neg_24	that the machine is being neglected .
13_kitchen_neg_25	We are very disappointed with this machine .
13_kitchen_neg_26	For the price
13_kitchen_neg_27	that you pay
13_kitchen_neg_28	you would think
13_kitchen_neg_29	that at least customer service would be polite , understanding and helpful .
13_kitchen_neg_30	Now we are looking for another machine , a back up one ,
13_kitchen_neg_31	to be able to send Impressa Z5 for service . .
