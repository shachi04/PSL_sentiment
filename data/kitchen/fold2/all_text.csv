2_kitchen_pos_1	When trying to decide if this model
2_kitchen_pos_2	-LRB- 3670G -RRB-
2_kitchen_pos_3	was the right vacuum for me ,
2_kitchen_pos_4	I found a considerable amount of confusing information regarding it 's features on the internet . .
2_kitchen_pos_5	and from the manufacturer itself .
2_kitchen_pos_6	First of all , many online retailers flat out state
2_kitchen_pos_7	-LRB- inaccurately -RRB-
2_kitchen_pos_8	"that this model has a "" HEPA """
2_kitchen_pos_9	-LRB- High Efficiency Particulate Air -RRB-
2_kitchen_pos_10	filter
2_kitchen_pos_11	and at least one of the reviews for it here on Amazon
2_kitchen_pos_12	-LRB- at least as of this writing -RRB-
2_kitchen_pos_13	seems
2_kitchen_pos_14	to indicate
2_kitchen_pos_15	that it has one as well .
2_kitchen_pos_16	I can tell you outright
2_kitchen_pos_17	that
2_kitchen_pos_18	having checked with the manufacturer directly
2_kitchen_pos_19	"and now owning one myself that it does \* NOT \* have a "" HEPA "" filter ."
2_kitchen_pos_20	More on that a little later in this review however .
2_kitchen_pos_21	I found another confusing aspect of the description
2_kitchen_pos_22	is in the model number
2_kitchen_pos_23	-LRB- i. e .
2_kitchen_pos_24	3670G -RRB- .
2_kitchen_pos_25	Be careful to understand the difference between what Amazon calls the 3670 -LRB- also called the 3670A in some places -RRB-
2_kitchen_pos_26	and the 3670 \* G \* models .
2_kitchen_pos_27	They look identical
2_kitchen_pos_28	and appear to be identical
2_kitchen_pos_29	-LRB- both are yellow and black -RRB-
2_kitchen_pos_30	however
2_kitchen_pos_31	the 3670 only has a 9 amp motor
2_kitchen_pos_32	and the 3670G has the larger , 12 amp motor .
2_kitchen_pos_33	Amazon carries both models
2_kitchen_pos_34	and I almost ended up
2_kitchen_pos_35	buying the smaller one thinking
2_kitchen_pos_36	it was the same vacuum .
2_kitchen_pos_37	For only about a $ 5 - $ 10 difference in total price ,
2_kitchen_pos_38	I 'm not sure
2_kitchen_pos_39	why the smaller version is even offered .
2_kitchen_pos_40	It only seems to confuse the matter .
2_kitchen_pos_41	"The 3670 also does \* NOT \* have the "" HEPA "" filter incidentally ."
2_kitchen_pos_42	I found the 3670G to be an excellent value however
2_kitchen_pos_43	and am pleased with my purchase .
2_kitchen_pos_44	It is compact , very powerful and great for my needs .
2_kitchen_pos_45	The noise . . . while high . . . is quite tolerable and not at all excessive
2_kitchen_pos_46	considering
2_kitchen_pos_47	how well it cleans .
2_kitchen_pos_48	The generously long cord wraps easily around the base for storage
2_kitchen_pos_49	and while a retractable cord would have been extremely useful ,
2_kitchen_pos_50	not having one is a reasonable trade-off in keeping the price down .
2_kitchen_pos_51	The blower port feature is very handy for cleaning my computer insides
2_kitchen_pos_52	-LRB- by blowing away dust
2_kitchen_pos_53	without contacting electrical components
2_kitchen_pos_54	as vacuuming would risk doing -RRB- .
2_kitchen_pos_55	The 3670G \* does \* require bags .
2_kitchen_pos_56	"It is not a "" bagless "" model however"
2_kitchen_pos_57	and while some may prefer a bagless model ,
2_kitchen_pos_58	I preferred a model
2_kitchen_pos_59	that used bags .
2_kitchen_pos_60	The bags are very easy to change on this model and not that much of an additional expense
2_kitchen_pos_61	for what I consider to be the additional convenience
2_kitchen_pos_62	-LRB- of being able to easily remove and dispose of a bag -RRB- .
2_kitchen_pos_63	The only reason I gave this model 4 stars and not 5 was because I did not find the attachment brushes quite adequate .
2_kitchen_pos_64	"Three attachment tools are included , a crevice tool , a 10 "" floor tool"
2_kitchen_pos_65	and a combination tool with a triangularly-shaped brush
2_kitchen_pos_66	"-LRB- about 2 "" wide -RRB-"
2_kitchen_pos_67	on the end .
2_kitchen_pos_68	The combination tool also flips over to double as brushless pick-up
2_kitchen_pos_69	"-LRB- 3 """
2_kitchen_pos_70	wide -RRB- .
2_kitchen_pos_71	In my opinion , this cleaner badly needs a mid-sized brush
2_kitchen_pos_72	and\/or pick up tool
2_kitchen_pos_73	"that is about 4-5 "" wide ."
2_kitchen_pos_74	"The 2 "" wide combination tool brush does concentrate the suction into a small area for high power"
2_kitchen_pos_75	"but being only 2 """
2_kitchen_pos_76	wide ,
2_kitchen_pos_77	I found
2_kitchen_pos_78	that I simply had to move it much too frequently on larger surfaces
2_kitchen_pos_79	-LRB- such as a wall for example -RRB-
2_kitchen_pos_80	in order to cover the area
2_kitchen_pos_81	needed .
2_kitchen_pos_82	"I would have rated this vacuum 5 stars if a brush about 4-5 """
2_kitchen_pos_83	wide had been included .
2_kitchen_pos_84	As it is ,
2_kitchen_pos_85	I am
2_kitchen_pos_86	searching for an optional brush
2_kitchen_pos_87	that size to purchase extra .
2_kitchen_pos_88	"Finally , a comment about the "" HEPA "" filter ."
2_kitchen_pos_89	Some people
2_kitchen_pos_90	-LRB- particularly those with allergies or who need extremely dust free air -RRB-
2_kitchen_pos_91	may want cleaners
2_kitchen_pos_92	that include this item .
2_kitchen_pos_93	In my case ,
2_kitchen_pos_94	I did not want this
2_kitchen_pos_95	since I do n't need it
2_kitchen_pos_96	"and "" HEPA "" filters can be quite expensive to change and replace"
2_kitchen_pos_97	-LRB-
2_kitchen_pos_98	unless you get a washable one . . . also expensive -RRB- .
2_kitchen_pos_99	Since many online descriptions I found were unclear
2_kitchen_pos_100	whether the 3670G included this filter
2_kitchen_pos_101	-LRB- some descriptions flatly stated that it does -RRB- ,
2_kitchen_pos_102	I found myself
2_kitchen_pos_103	calling the Eureka customer service number to find out for sure .
2_kitchen_pos_104	It turned out
2_kitchen_pos_105	that even Eureka 's own customer service representative was unsure
2_kitchen_pos_106	whether it contained the filter or not and had to take some considerable time to find out that it did n't have one .
2_kitchen_pos_107	"If you \* do \* want the "" HEPA "" filter ,"
2_kitchen_pos_108	you would want the 3684D . . .
2_kitchen_pos_109	which looks the same but is red in color , slightly more expensive ,
2_kitchen_pos_110	"and has more and better quality attachments as well as the "" HEPA "" filter ."
2_kitchen_pos_111	By the time
2_kitchen_pos_112	you add in the cost of an optional additional attachment
2_kitchen_pos_113	-LRB-
2_kitchen_pos_114	which I mentioned earlier
2_kitchen_pos_115	that I think
2_kitchen_pos_116	is needed on the 3670G -RRB- ,
2_kitchen_pos_117	you are at the price of a 3684D .
2_kitchen_pos_118	In that case , the 3684D may well be a better value for you ,
2_kitchen_pos_119	"particularly if you like the "" HEPA "" filter ."
2_kitchen_pos_120	Overall ,
2_kitchen_pos_121	I think
2_kitchen_pos_122	"The Boss "" series of canister vacuums is a great product ."
2_kitchen_pos_123	Eureka
2_kitchen_pos_124	-LRB- and Amazon as well -RRB-
2_kitchen_pos_125	needs
2_kitchen_pos_126	to do a much better job of clarifying the differences between the particular models in the series however .
