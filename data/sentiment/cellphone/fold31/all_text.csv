11_cell_neg_1	Purchased this phone as an upgrade from the i530 ,
11_cell_neg_2	which I loved .
11_cell_neg_3	I was at the end of a 2 year contract , and felt that I would get something with a few more bells and whistles - and was excited about the color screen with the icons .
11_cell_neg_4	Two of my family members have higher end Nextels and all work well .
11_cell_neg_5	I would have purchased one of those ,
11_cell_neg_6	except I did n't really care about a camera for my phone ,
11_cell_neg_7	and this one was reasonably priced . . .
11_cell_neg_8	and I found out
11_cell_neg_9	you get
11_cell_neg_10	what you pay for !
11_cell_neg_11	The i560 felt almost cheap in construction
11_cell_neg_12	compared to the i750 , i870 and even my old i530 .
11_cell_neg_13	I had it for a couple of weeks
11_cell_neg_14	when I started having trouble with the clarity of my calls -
11_cell_neg_15	I could hear them ,
11_cell_neg_16	but they could n't hear me .
11_cell_neg_17	A couple of times ,
11_cell_neg_18	I had the screen go to Airplane Mode ,
11_cell_neg_19	even when I had n't touched it .
11_cell_neg_20	The fact that you had to take the whole phone out
11_cell_neg_21	to see
11_cell_neg_22	who is calling was another downside , too .
11_cell_neg_23	My previous phone had to be flipped open to see
11_cell_neg_24	who was calling ,
11_cell_neg_25	but I had a holster
11_cell_neg_26	that could hold the phone without disengaging it .
11_cell_neg_27	Not a great design for this holster .
11_cell_neg_28	Another problem is with the power supply .
11_cell_neg_29	When charging the phone ,
11_cell_neg_30	it is especially important to make sure the plug is seated tight - and to check
11_cell_neg_31	that is says device
11_cell_neg_32	attached -
11_cell_neg_33	it comes out easy
11_cell_neg_34	and stops charging
11_cell_neg_35	even
11_cell_neg_36	when it appears to be plugged into the phone correctly .
11_cell_neg_37	Then I am on a phone call on speakerphone
11_cell_neg_38	and the whole speaker just stops working .
11_cell_neg_39	Living in California apparently gives us an advantage - 30 day risk free guarantee .
11_cell_neg_40	Fortunately ,
11_cell_neg_41	we were on day 12 ,
11_cell_neg_42	and
11_cell_neg_43	after 54 minutes , one accidental disconnection by Nextel
11_cell_neg_44	and 6 customer service agents ,
11_cell_neg_45	I finally received a return authorization
11_cell_neg_46	and placed a new order .
11_cell_neg_47	Terrible , terrible phone .
11_cell_neg_48	Stay away from it .
11_cell_neg_49	Hoping the new one on it 's way works much better !
11_cell_neg_50	Michell
