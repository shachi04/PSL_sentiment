6_kitchen_neg_1	My wife bought this one from Best Buy without me reviewing
6_kitchen_neg_2	it 1st .
6_kitchen_neg_3	Amazingly ,
6_kitchen_neg_4	I would have bought it after reading the reviews here .
6_kitchen_neg_5	I 'm starting to wonder
6_kitchen_neg_6	who writes these things . . .
6_kitchen_neg_7	LG employees ?
6_kitchen_neg_8	The microwave is fine - no complaints .
6_kitchen_neg_9	The toaster , however , is an unmitigated disaster .
6_kitchen_neg_10	I am of the opinion that you should rarely combine appliances
6_kitchen_neg_11	- this appliance is a poster child for this thought .
6_kitchen_neg_12	The toaster browns extremely unevenly and inconsistently
6_kitchen_neg_13	-LRB- sometimes you should toast the same piece of bread on 5
6_kitchen_neg_14	and sometimes as high as 10 ! -RRB- .
6_kitchen_neg_15	More importantly , the toaster broke
6_kitchen_neg_16	after 31 days
6_kitchen_neg_17	-LRB- coincidently the Best Buy return policy
6_kitchen_neg_18	ends at the same time -
6_kitchen_neg_19	Best Buy has an unacceptable return policy
6_kitchen_neg_20	"but with a guy named "" Ricky """
6_kitchen_neg_21	managing the store
6_kitchen_neg_22	what can you expect ? -RRB- .
6_kitchen_neg_23	LG picks up the phone quickly
6_kitchen_neg_24	and they honor the warranty .
6_kitchen_neg_25	The problem is they ca n't think outside of the box .
6_kitchen_neg_26	They had me get it repaired
6_kitchen_neg_27	but I have to inconveniently drive it out there
6_kitchen_neg_28	and pick it up - OK . . .
6_kitchen_neg_29	no problem .
6_kitchen_neg_30	One day later ?
6_kitchen_neg_31	It breaks again .
6_kitchen_neg_32	It is an extremely poorly built appliance and the repair people thought
6_kitchen_neg_33	they had fixed it
6_kitchen_neg_34	and had not .
6_kitchen_neg_35	That 's how bad it was .
6_kitchen_neg_36	LG will not budge - have
6_kitchen_neg_37	it repaired again
6_kitchen_neg_38	-LRB- great option - costs LG money ,
6_kitchen_neg_39	me more travel time ,
6_kitchen_neg_40	and it wo n't do the job -RRB-
6_kitchen_neg_41	or do a rebate .
6_kitchen_neg_42	The rebate requires me to buy another LG or Goldstar product .
6_kitchen_neg_43	Huh ?
6_kitchen_neg_44	So you create a shoddy product
6_kitchen_neg_45	and rush it to the marketplace
6_kitchen_neg_46	-LRB- they admitted
6_kitchen_neg_47	they do n't have a detailed enough repair history
6_kitchen_neg_48	because it is too new -RRB-
6_kitchen_neg_49	and then do n't stand behind your product .
6_kitchen_neg_50	You backend
6_kitchen_neg_51	me into another LG or Goldstar product that I would not have otherwise bought .
6_kitchen_neg_52	How does our government allow these atrocious foreign companies to business here ?
6_kitchen_neg_53	Our we so bad as a manufacturer
6_kitchen_neg_54	that we ca n't top this ?
6_kitchen_neg_55	Their supervisors were very hardlined and there was no
6_kitchen_neg_56	getting around this .
6_kitchen_neg_57	You can cal Korea
6_kitchen_neg_58	"but they wo n't change their policy """
6_kitchen_neg_59	they said .
6_kitchen_neg_60	I will never willingly buy another LG or Goldstar product
6_kitchen_neg_61	and I highly recommend
6_kitchen_neg_62	you do the same .
6_kitchen_neg_63	Shame on you LG - you could have had me as an appliance buyer for the next 50 years
6_kitchen_neg_64	and now your name is mud to me
