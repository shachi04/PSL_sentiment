1_gourmet_neg_1	I really do like my Senseo coffee maker .
1_gourmet_neg_2	I , like others
1_gourmet_neg_3	who have reviewed the Kona Pods here , was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine .
1_gourmet_neg_4	I was excited to see
1_gourmet_neg_5	that Kona now made pods
1_gourmet_neg_6	and was also happy to see
1_gourmet_neg_7	that they had a pod
1_gourmet_neg_8	that was a ' 2 cup style ' .
1_gourmet_neg_9	I have not found it to be a huge deal
1_gourmet_neg_10	to use 2 smaller '
1_gourmet_neg_11	1 cup ' size pods ,
1_gourmet_neg_12	but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of 2 smaller one .
1_gourmet_neg_13	After reading some of the reviews here ,
1_gourmet_neg_14	I could not figure out
1_gourmet_neg_15	what some of the reviewers meant by the Kona pods
1_gourmet_neg_16	making different amount of coffee per cup each time or how the coffee could be strange and undrinkable .
1_gourmet_neg_17	It just did n't make sense .
1_gourmet_neg_18	Well ,
1_gourmet_neg_19	it still does n't make sense ,
1_gourmet_neg_20	but it certainly happened with the coffee
1_gourmet_neg_21	I made using the Kona pods also .
1_gourmet_neg_22	My results were overall poor and it was very disappointing as the Kona pods cost a lot more than Folgers or other pod brands that I can buy locally .
1_gourmet_neg_23	The first thing I noticed was that the coffee in the 2 cup sized Kona pods is packed in much
1_gourmet_neg_24	more tightly than in any other pod
1_gourmet_neg_25	I have ever used in my Senseo .
1_gourmet_neg_26	The instructions for the Kona pods say
1_gourmet_neg_27	to wiggle the pods to break up the coffee before inserting into the machine .
1_gourmet_neg_28	The Kona pods feel very hard
1_gourmet_neg_29	when taken out of their package .
1_gourmet_neg_30	I always wiggled and jiggled the pods for about 10 seconds
1_gourmet_neg_31	before putting them in the Senseo .
1_gourmet_neg_32	After my problems with the Kona pods ,
1_gourmet_neg_33	my husband decided that I was not ' wiggling '
1_gourmet_neg_34	them enough .
1_gourmet_neg_35	He promptly wiggled one to the point that it broke open .
1_gourmet_neg_36	So ,
1_gourmet_neg_37	there is just so much
1_gourmet_neg_38	that can be done to the pod
1_gourmet_neg_39	before putting it in the machine .
1_gourmet_neg_40	The first thing that I noticed was that the amount of coffee
1_gourmet_neg_41	brewed
1_gourmet_neg_42	when using the Kona pod was quite a bit less than when using 2 smaller pods .
1_gourmet_neg_43	That did not make much sense ,
1_gourmet_neg_44	but after several cups of Kona ,
1_gourmet_neg_45	it was obvious
1_gourmet_neg_46	that there was never the amount of coffee
1_gourmet_neg_47	coming out as before when using 2 small one cup pods .
1_gourmet_neg_48	The best I can figure out is that the Kona pods
1_gourmet_neg_49	themselves seem to ' hold ' a lot more water .
1_gourmet_neg_50	There is more water
1_gourmet_neg_51	that remains in the pod itself
1_gourmet_neg_52	after the brewing is done .
1_gourmet_neg_53	The pod itself is heavier
1_gourmet_neg_54	when I take
1_gourmet_neg_55	it out to throw it away .
1_gourmet_neg_56	So ,
1_gourmet_neg_57	I believe
1_gourmet_neg_58	the reason
1_gourmet_neg_59	that there is less actual coffee using Kona pods is that the pods themselves retain a lot more water
1_gourmet_neg_60	and it can not pass through into the coffee cup .
1_gourmet_neg_61	Then ,
1_gourmet_neg_62	as others have mentioned ,
1_gourmet_neg_63	there is the problem
1_gourmet_neg_64	that happens to me about 1\/2 the time
1_gourmet_neg_65	when using the Kona pods .
1_gourmet_neg_66	The problem is that for whatever reason ,
1_gourmet_neg_67	the water does not actually go through
1_gourmet_neg_68	and penetrate the Kona pods during the brewing cycle .
1_gourmet_neg_69	The ' coffee '
1_gourmet_neg_70	that is supposed to be coming out of the spout is just water !
1_gourmet_neg_71	This problem is one that I still can not really figure out .
1_gourmet_neg_72	The Kona pods are a little smaller in diameter than all the other pods
1_gourmet_neg_73	I have tried .
1_gourmet_neg_74	So ,
1_gourmet_neg_75	I guess that somehow the water has enough room to ' go around ' the actual pod
1_gourmet_neg_76	and come out of the spout without ' going through ' the pod
1_gourmet_neg_77	to brew coffee .
1_gourmet_neg_78	I also wonder if the paper filter of the Kona pods is different than other pods
1_gourmet_neg_79	and for some reason the Kona paper is more difficult for water
1_gourmet_neg_80	to penetrate .
1_gourmet_neg_81	I have tried
1_gourmet_neg_82	wetting the Kona pod paper filter right before starting to brew the coffee
1_gourmet_neg_83	thinking that perhaps it would help the water
1_gourmet_neg_84	to penetrate the paper and pod .
1_gourmet_neg_85	But , that has not worked for me .
1_gourmet_neg_86	So ,
1_gourmet_neg_87	it is back to regular more reasonably priced coffee pods for me .
1_gourmet_neg_88	I have wasted too many expensive Kona pods trying to get a proper cup of coffee from them .
1_gourmet_neg_89	Even when the Kona pods brew a cup of coffee ,
1_gourmet_neg_90	it is not as large of an amount of coffee as I get
1_gourmet_neg_91	using other brands .
1_gourmet_neg_92	So ,
1_gourmet_neg_93	adding the cost of the Kona pods to the fact
1_gourmet_neg_94	that it brews a smaller amount of coffee equals a product
1_gourmet_neg_95	that is way too expensive
1_gourmet_neg_96	when it does actually work .
1_gourmet_neg_97	I have been reading of a product
1_gourmet_neg_98	called an EcoPod .
1_gourmet_neg_99	It is a refillable pod for these type of coffeemakers .
1_gourmet_neg_100	It might be the next thing
1_gourmet_neg_101	I try .
