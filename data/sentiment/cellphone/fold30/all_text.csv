10_cell_neg_1	When I recieved this item ,
10_cell_neg_2	I had mixed emotions for the product .
10_cell_neg_3	On one hand ,
10_cell_neg_4	the black finish looked very nice ,
10_cell_neg_5	and the clear plastic covering protected the screen
10_cell_neg_6	but was still easy to read .
10_cell_neg_7	Also , all of the side buttons are fairly easy to reach with average-sized fingers
10_cell_neg_8	-LRB- except maybe the camera button -RRB- ,
10_cell_neg_9	so navigating the phone with the cover still closed is pretty easy
10_cell_neg_10	unless you need
10_cell_neg_11	to use touch functions or open the QWERTY keyboard .
10_cell_neg_12	However , due to the padding and the nature of the metal materials , the case is very thick and bulky -
10_cell_neg_13	when using the belt clip , the phone sticks out far
10_cell_neg_14	enough that it does not even rest evenly on your hip ,
10_cell_neg_15	but leans at an angle .
10_cell_neg_16	BUT , the deciding factor in my two-star rating is that this case was the cause of the only two times I have dropped my Cingular 8525 -LRB-
10_cell_neg_17	which at such a steep price , is not something
10_cell_neg_18	I like to drop -RRB- .
10_cell_neg_19	The problem lies with the snap-shut system
10_cell_neg_20	that closes the case .
10_cell_neg_21	Because the metal is so thin ,
10_cell_neg_22	it does not secure very well ,
10_cell_neg_23	and can come open pretty easily .
10_cell_neg_24	To fix this ,
10_cell_neg_25	I simply bent the piece of metal downward and towards the phone ,
10_cell_neg_26	so that it was much harder to both open and close the case .
10_cell_neg_27	This , for the most part , solves the problem ,
10_cell_neg_28	but it is still dangerous
10_cell_neg_29	and caution is DEFINATELY in order .
10_cell_neg_30	My favorite thing about this case is that you can open the case
10_cell_neg_31	and slide the keyboard open without actually taking the phone out of the case .
10_cell_neg_32	This is nice
10_cell_neg_33	because it enable quick replies to text messages .
10_cell_neg_34	This is the only reason
10_cell_neg_35	I did not give it a one-star rating .
10_cell_neg_36	I am currently looking for a soft case , preferably a leather sleeve case that I can just pull my phone out of off of my hip ,
10_cell_neg_37	rather than bother with a clip anymore .
10_cell_neg_38	As a final warning - BE
10_cell_neg_39	CAREFUL if you buy this case .
10_cell_neg_40	Plus ,
10_cell_neg_41	I seriously do not believe
10_cell_neg_42	it is worth its steep price point
