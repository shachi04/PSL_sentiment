5_kitchen_neg_1	Amazing
5_kitchen_neg_2	that in 2005
5_kitchen_neg_3	you can read review
5_kitchen_neg_4	after review on Amazon about the poor quality of almost every toaster
5_kitchen_neg_5	offered .
5_kitchen_neg_6	We hoped this one would be an exception .
5_kitchen_neg_7	It was ,
5_kitchen_neg_8	but only in that it may be the poorest of them all .
5_kitchen_neg_9	Ours buzzed loudly whenever in use .
5_kitchen_neg_10	Never had a toaster buzz before .
5_kitchen_neg_11	We toast bread at least twice a day ,
5_kitchen_neg_12	and the toasting performance of this unit is horrible .
5_kitchen_neg_13	It has no bagel setting
5_kitchen_neg_14	-LRB-
5_kitchen_neg_15	which toasts the cut side more than the crust side -RRB- ,
5_kitchen_neg_16	so we ended up with one side burnt and the other barely
5_kitchen_neg_17	starting to toast .
5_kitchen_neg_18	What 's more ,
5_kitchen_neg_19	it toasts completely unevenly .
5_kitchen_neg_20	One corner of toast will be blackened
5_kitchen_neg_21	while the far corner will barely be tanned .
5_kitchen_neg_22	And it 's really annoying
5_kitchen_neg_23	when a 4-slice toaster does not allow you to operate the heating elements independently .
5_kitchen_neg_24	As far as looks go ,
5_kitchen_neg_25	De ' Longhi did just as bad a job .
5_kitchen_neg_26	The photos look cool ,
5_kitchen_neg_27	"but the crumb tray this unit "" sits """
5_kitchen_neg_28	upon is actually wider than the unit
5_kitchen_neg_29	itself ,
5_kitchen_neg_30	so there is a big uneven gap at the seam .
5_kitchen_neg_31	It 's the lower line
5_kitchen_neg_32	you see in the photos --
5_kitchen_neg_33	but they make
5_kitchen_neg_34	it look real nice for that !
5_kitchen_neg_35	What you do n't see is the other side of the toaster
5_kitchen_neg_36	where the bottom crumb tray will be sticking out several MM from the side of the toaster rather than being flush
5_kitchen_neg_37	as shown .
5_kitchen_neg_38	This makes it look broken , like two pieces of something
5_kitchen_neg_39	that no longer fit together .
5_kitchen_neg_40	If De ' Longhi had spent even a second thinking about this ,
5_kitchen_neg_41	they would have done the opposite :
5_kitchen_neg_42	The bottom tray should be slightly smaller than the toasting unit ,
5_kitchen_neg_43	which would give the unit a seamless look rather than a busted look .
5_kitchen_neg_44	-LRB- We even went to a store
5_kitchen_neg_45	-LRB- yes , a real store -RRB-
5_kitchen_neg_46	to confirm
5_kitchen_neg_47	that they are all like this ,
5_kitchen_neg_48	and they are . -RRB-
5_kitchen_neg_49	Also , the bread warming rack is another poorly designed element .
5_kitchen_neg_50	There are 4 tiny plastic feet
5_kitchen_neg_51	inserted into the four metal posts of the rack so it does n't scratch the metal surface of the toaster .
5_kitchen_neg_52	However ,
5_kitchen_neg_53	two of the feet had already fallen out during shipping ,
5_kitchen_neg_54	and though they slipped right back in , all four of the tiny feet can easily be removed or fall out
5_kitchen_neg_55	-LRB- only friction holds them in -RRB-
5_kitchen_neg_56	and
5_kitchen_neg_57	you WILL loose them very quickly -- especially if you ever wash the rack .
5_kitchen_neg_58	We ` re happy to pay extra for a quality item -- even a toaster --
5_kitchen_neg_59	but we expect something in return besides utter dissapointment .
5_kitchen_neg_60	Final advice :
5_kitchen_neg_61	Stick to the $ 20 toasters with functions such as bagel , defrost , and dual controls .
5_kitchen_neg_62	If it 's ugly , keep
5_kitchen_neg_63	it under the sink
5_kitchen_neg_64	and only take it out
5_kitchen_neg_65	when you use it .
5_kitchen_neg_66	This one looks broken , performs poorly , and costs a lot of money .
5_kitchen_neg_67	If you do buy this model ,
5_kitchen_neg_68	maybe you ` ll get ours . . .
5_kitchen_neg_69	we returned it
