9_gourmet_neg_1	I have multiple concerns with this product .
9_gourmet_neg_2	Out of the box ,
9_gourmet_neg_3	they really do look fresh
9_gourmet_neg_4	and plump like they do in the picture .
9_gourmet_neg_5	However ,
9_gourmet_neg_6	you soon notice the lack of instructions .
9_gourmet_neg_7	None .
9_gourmet_neg_8	"The only documentation at all is a "" California "" sticker . . ."
9_gourmet_neg_9	with no reference to a web site .
9_gourmet_neg_10	Nada .
9_gourmet_neg_11	My grapes broke quickly .
9_gourmet_neg_12	When I received them
9_gourmet_neg_13	they looked just like the picture .
9_gourmet_neg_14	But in a couple days I started noticing
9_gourmet_neg_15	they were n't as plump
9_gourmet_neg_16	and were shriveling .
9_gourmet_neg_17	Withing a week ,
9_gourmet_neg_18	many were brown
9_gourmet_neg_19	and certainly lacked freshness .
9_gourmet_neg_20	It was so bad ,
9_gourmet_neg_21	that I was in shock ,
9_gourmet_neg_22	and I kept
9_gourmet_neg_23	holding up the picture next to them to compare
9_gourmet_neg_24	because I could n't believe
9_gourmet_neg_25	it .
9_gourmet_neg_26	It was like they were deteriorating right before my eyes .
9_gourmet_neg_27	Within a month they looked awful .
9_gourmet_neg_28	They looked like moldy raisins .
9_gourmet_neg_29	Really Moldy .
9_gourmet_neg_30	Not recommended
