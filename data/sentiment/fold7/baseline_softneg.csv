Amazing 	0.25
that  in  2005 	0.0001
you  can  read  review 	0.0001
after  review  on  Amazon  about  the  poor  quality  of  almost  every  toaster 	0.0001
offered  . 	0.0001
We  hoped  this  one  would  be  an  exception  . 	0.125
It  was  , 	0.125
but  only  in  that  it  may  be  the  poorest  of  them  all  . 	0.125
Ours  buzzed  loudly  whenever  in  use  . 	0.0001
Never  had  a  toaster  buzz  before  . 	0.625
We  toast  bread  at  least  twice  a  day  , 	0.0001
and  the  toasting  performance  of  this  unit  is  horrible  . 	0.125
It  has  no  bagel  setting 	0.0001
-LRB- 	0.0001
which  toasts  the  cut  side  more  than  the  crust  side  -RRB-  , 	0.125
so  we  ended  up  with  one  side  burnt  and  the  other  barely 	0.625
starting  to  toast  . 	0.0001
What  's  more  , 	0.0001
it  toasts  completely  unevenly  . 	0.0001
One  corner  of  toast  will  be  blackened 	0.125
while  the  far  corner  will  barely  be  tanned  . 	0.125
And  it  's  really  annoying 	0.0001
when  a  4-slice  toaster  does  not  allow  you  to  operate  the  heating  elements  independently  . 	0.4583333333333333
As  far  as  looks  go  , 	0.0001
De  '  Longhi  did  just  as  bad  a  job  . 	0.625
The  photos  look  cool  , 	0.125
"but  the  crumb  tray  this  unit  ""  sits  "" "	0.0001
upon  is  actually  wider  than  the  unit 	0.125
itself  , 	0.0001
so  there  is  a  big  uneven  gap  at  the  seam  . 	0.125
It  's  the  lower  line 	0.25
you  see  in  the  photos  -- 	0.0001
but  they  make 	0.0001
it  look  real  nice  for  that  ! 	0.0001
What  you  do  n't  see  is  the  other  side  of  the  toaster 	0.375
where  the  bottom  crumb  tray  will  be  sticking  out  several  MM  from  the  side  of  the  toaster  rather  than  being  flush 	0.21875
as  shown  . 	0.0001
This  makes  it  look  broken  ,  like  two  pieces  of  something 	0.125
that  no  longer  fit  together  . 	0.5
If  De  '  Longhi  had  spent  even  a  second  thinking  about  this  , 	0.0001
they  would  have  done  the  opposite  : 	0.0001
The  bottom  tray  should  be  slightly  smaller  than  the  toasting  unit  , 	0.20833333333333331
which  would  give  the  unit  a  seamless  look  rather  than  a  busted  look  . 	0.375
-LRB-  We  even  went  to  a  store 	0.0001

to  confirm 	0.0001
that  they  are  all  like  this  , 	0.125
and  they  are  .  -RRB- 	0.125
Also  ,  the  bread  warming  rack  is  another  poorly  designed  element  . 	0.4375
There  are  4  tiny  plastic  feet 	0.125
inserted  into  the  four  metal  posts  of  the  rack  so  it  does  n't  scratch  the  metal  surface  of  the  toaster  . 	0.25
However  , 	0.5
two  of  the  feet  had  already  fallen  out  during  shipping  , 	0.0001
and  though  they  slipped  right  back  in  ,  all  four  of  the  tiny  feet  can  easily  be  removed  or  fall  out 	0.125
-LRB-  only  friction  holds  them  in  -RRB- 	0.0001
and 	0.0001
you  WILL  loose  them  very  quickly  --  especially  if  you  ever  wash  the  rack  . 	0.25
We  `  re  happy  to  pay  extra  for  a  quality  item  --  even  a  toaster  -- 	0.0001
but  we  expect  something  in  return  besides  utter  dissapointment  . 	0.25
Final  advice  : 	0.0001
Stick  to  the  $  20  toasters  with  functions  such  as  bagel  ,  defrost  ,  and  dual  controls  . 	0.0001
If  it  's  ugly  ,  keep 	0.0001
it  under  the  sink 	0.0001
and  only  take  it  out 	0.0001
when  you  use  it  . 	0.0001
This  one  looks  broken  ,  performs  poorly  ,  and  costs  a  lot  of  money  . 	0.4375

This  carafe  was  initially  perfect  . 	0.125
The  design  is  attractive  and  simple  , 	0.25
and  it  fits  well  in  my  bag  in  the  mornings  . 	0.0001
The  problem  then  began  that 	0.625

after  being  turned  the  slightest  direction  other  than  straight  up  . 	0.3125
I  'd  suggest 	0.0001

Here  's  my  take  : 	0.0001
PROS  : 	0.0001
-  Durability  ; 	0.0001
this  thing  was  built  with  the  clumsy  in  mind 	0.125
-LRB-  like  me  -RRB-  . 	0.0001
I  must  have  dropped  this  thing  a  dozen  times 	0.0001

-  MP3  player  ; 	0.0001
I  agree 	0.0001
that  the  onboard  5MB  of  memory  is  a  joke  , 	0.125

I  bought  my  512MB  chip  on  eBay  for  $  7.99  -RRB- 	0.0001
then 	0.0001
upgrading  is  easy  and  affordable  . 	0.1875
That  being  said  ,  the  MP3  player  is  a  feature 	0.125
you  will  actually  USE  , 	0.0001
and  the  sound  quality  is  good  . 	0.125
I  `  ve  had  no  problem  with  playing  my  iTunes  music 	0.625
-LRB-  as  long  as  they  `  re  mp3  format  AND  no  greater  that  192Kbps  in  quality 	0.25

I  read 	0.0001
where  one  user  complained 	0.75
that  the  camera  button  was  not  on  the  side  , 	0.375
it  was  the  camera  icon  button  on  the  front  keypad  . 	0.125
He  must  not  have  known 	0.625
"that  you  can  reprogram  all  of  the  smart  buttons  from  the  ""  Personalize  ""  menu  . "	0.625
Not  only  that  , 	0.625

It  's  a  handy  little  feature  . 	0.25

when  the  phone  is  powered  off  -RRB-  . 	0.125
It  's  annoying  . 	0.0001
-  The  onboard  memory  is  a  joke  . 	0.125
You  really  need  to  upgrade  the  memory  if  you  want  to  do  anything  extra  with  the  phone  . 	0.25
-  It  has  a  monochrome  outer  display 	0.0001
-LRB-  full  color  inside  -RRB-  . 	0.0001
This  does  n't  bother  me  at  all  , 	0.375
but  it  's  not  as  flashy  as  Razr  or  other  phones  . 	0.625
OVERALL  : 	0.0001
This  is  a  great  ,  durable  little  phone  with  handy  features  I  think 	0.25

I  `  ve  read 	0.0001

and  does  n't  look  like  a  tricked-out  teenager  's  phone  , 	0.0001
then  this  is  the  phone  for  you  . 	0.125
I  read  the  reviews 	0.0001
before  I  purchased  this  machine  . 	0.0001
I  know  from  experience  that  reviews  are  extremely  subjective  and  often  times  people  misuse  the  appliance  or  simply  expect  more  than  a  machine  is  capable  of  . 	0.21875
So  with  this  in  mind 	0.0001
I  will  put  in  my  2  cents  . 	0.0001
I  have  had  my  machine  for  two  months  and  I  use  it  about  4  times  a  week  on  a  200  square  foot  vinyl  kitchen  floor  that  accomodates  two  adults  ,  a  4  year  old 	0.0001
and  two  dogs  . 	0.0001
Generally  it  works  pretty  well  and  is  much  more  convenient  than  a  regular  mop  and  bucket  . 	0.20833333333333331
You  must  remember  that  this  is  a  low  cost  residential  machine 	0.1875
and  as  such  will  not  replace  the  suction  and  scrubbing  power  of  a  serious  vacuum  and  elbow  grease  . 	0.46875
The  machine  is  set  up  to  auto-shut  off 	0.125
if  you  move  the  machine  quickly  or  drop  it  down  low  . 	0.25
I  agree  with  with  the  other  writers  about  the  poor  suction  capability 	0.375
but  you  must  consider  the  overall  design  of  the  machine  . 	0.0001
A  powerful  adjustable  head  machine 	0.0001
that  would  pick  up  more  than  dog  hair  and  dust  would  be  cost  prohibitive  . 	0.125
I  see 	0.0001
what  Hoover  was  trying  to  do  with  this  machine  . 	0.125
They  were  trying  to  accomodate  our  scrubbing 	0.125
and  vacuuming  needs  in  one  cost  effective  machine  . 	0.125
They  gave  it  a  good  shot 	0.125
but  for  all  of  us  clean-freaks  this  machine  does  n't  quite  hit  the  mark  . 	0.125
The  water\/cleaning  solution  section  is  ,  in  my  humble  opinion  ,  to  small  . 	0.40625
I  run  out  of  water  quickly 	0.0001
and  I  have  a  very  small  kitchen  . 	0.3125
But  the  good  news  is  that  my  kitchen  is  so  small 	0.20833333333333331
I  can  take  three  steps  over  to  the  sink 	0.0001
and  fill  it  up  . 	0.0001
:  -RRB- 	0.0001
One  more  comment 	0.0001
before  I  give  my  final  review  .  .  . 	0.125
remember  to  follow  the  instructions 	0.0001
and  use  ONLY 	0.0001
the  kind  of  cleaners  Hoover  recommends  . 	0.0001
There  's  a  reason  for  this  . 	0.0001
If  you  use  regular  household  cleaners 	0.0001
that  cut  crease  you  will  damage  your  machine 	0.75
and  it  will  most  certainly  leak  and  die  ! 	0.0001
The  grease  cutting  agents  in  regular  household  cleaners  and  soaps  strip  the  bearings 	0.25
and  fry  the  gaskets  . 	0.0001
So  my  final  opinion  is  this  . 	0.375
If  you  have  a  relatively  small  space 	0.375
and  need  a  daily  quick  scrub 	0.25
it  's  a  great  time  saver  . 	0.25
It  's  a  good  overall  cleaner  if  you  need  a  quick  vac-up  of  dog  hair  ,  scrub  and  mop  . 	0.25
Any  more  heavy  duty  than  that 	0.0001
and  you  are  back  to  the  good  old  vacuum  attachment  ,  mop  and  bucket  routine  . 	0.25
If  you  are  a  cleanfreak  ,  like  me  , 	0.125
you  know  that  nothing  replaces  a  good  old  fashioned  hand-and-knees  scrub  . 	0.3125
No  machine  will  ever  leave  you  satisfied  . 	0.0001
This  machine  was  definately  NOT  made  for  heavy  duty  cleaning 	0.375
but  for  light  daily  use 	0.25
it  's  great  . 	0.0001
I  am 	0.125
giving  this  machine  4  stars 	0.125
because  I  think 	0.0001
it  does  what  it  was  designed  to  do  .  .  .  light  cleaning  . 	0.125
I  would  have  given  it  5  stars 	0.125
if  the  cleaning  solution  bucket  was  larger 	0.125
and  the  cut  off  mechanism  was  a  little  more  liberal  and  a  little  more  suction  power 	0.3125
would  have  been  nice  . 	0.125
When  Hoover  finally  comes  up  with  a  heavy  duty  scrubber  with  the  suction  power  of  a  regular  vacuum  , 	0.375
scrubbing  power  of  my  own  elbow  and  ability  to  get  into  corners  and  baseboards  I  `  ll  be  all  over  it  ! 	0.25
Until  then  , 	0.0001
I  `  ll  settle  for  a  daily  scrub  with  this  machine  and  a  good  hand  scrub  once  a  month  . 	0.0001
We  bought  a  well-reviewed  carpet  vacuum  from  Amazon  last  year  , 	0.375
and  absolutely  love  it  . 	0.0001
After  that  positive  experience  , 	0.0001
we  were  looking  for  something  for  our  kitchen  ,  bathroom  and  hallway  floors 	0.125
and  came  upon  this  cleaner  . 	0.0001
Starting  with  the  dry  vac  part  , 	0.25
that 	0.0001
seems 	0.0001
to  get  smallish  pieces  of  dirt  fine  ,  but  anything  Cheerio  sized  or  larger  it  pushes  around  on  the  floor  unless  you  lean  the  vacuum  back  . 	0.20833333333333331
Which  would  be  fine  , 	0.125
but  if  you  lean  it  back  too  far  , 	0.25
there  is  a  suction  filter  thing 	0.125
-LRB-  made 	0.0001
for  the  wet  vac  part  -RRB- 	0.0001
that  sticks  and  you  have  to  turn  off  the  vacuum 	0.375
and  wait  about  10  seconds  for  the  suction 	0.0001
to  release  that  piece 	0.0001
before  you  can  continue  . 	0.0001
Anyway  , 	0.0001
the  small  dirt  and  dust  are  really  picked  up  quite  well  , 	0.375
but  if  any  of  you 	0.0001
have  small  children 	0.375
-LRB-  we  have  3  boys  under  6  -RRB-  , 	0.0001
do  n't  have  any  expectations  of  this  getting  up  mealtime  messes  . 	0.125
Now  ,  onto  the  wet  vac  part  , 	0.0001
which  was  the  main  reason 	0.125
we  got  this  . 	0.0001
Very  disappointing  . 	0.0001
We  used  the  included  cleaner  ,  warm  tap  water  ,  etc  as  the  directions  indicated  , 	0.0001
and  both  my  wife  and  I  swear  the  floor  is  no  cleaner  than  when  we  started  . 	0.125
It  does  n't  look  cleaner  ,  shine  more  or  even  have  a  nice  smell 	0.25
that  we  could  even  close  our  eyes  and  pretend 	0.25
it  was  clean  . 	0.25
Spills  or  stains  that  normally  take  1-3  passes  with  a  mop  are  taking  8-12  passes  with  this  machine  . 	0.4375
We  bought  this  to  save  time  and\/or  get  cleaner  floors  , 	0.0001
and  I  can  honestly  say 	0.0001
that  this  machine  did  not  do  either  . 	0.625
As  briefly  noted  above  , 	0.0001
if  you  have  children  ,  do  not  expect  clean  floors  out  of  this  , 	0.4166666666666667
and  I  ca  n't  recommend  this  at  all  . 	0.125

I  really  do  like  my  Senseo  coffee  maker  . 	0.0001
I  ,  like  others 	0.0001
who  have  reviewed  the  Kona  Pods  here  ,  was  always  searching  for  a  better  tasting  coffee  pod  to  use  in  the  machine  . 	0.1875
I  was  excited  to  see 	0.25
that  Kona  now  made  pods 	0.0001
and  was  also  happy  to  see 	0.125
that  they  had  a  pod 	0.0001
that  was  a  '  2  cup  style  '  . 	0.125
I  have  not  found  it  to  be  a  huge  deal 	0.375
to  use  2  smaller  ' 	0.375
1  cup  '  size  pods  , 	0.375
but  it  sounded  nice  to  be  able  to  just  put  one  large  pod  in  the  machine  instead  of  2  smaller  one  . 	0.20833333333333331
After  reading  some  of  the  reviews  here  , 	0.0001
I  could  not  figure  out 	0.625
what  some  of  the  reviewers  meant  by  the  Kona  pods 	0.0001
making  different  amount  of  coffee  per  cup  each  time  or  how  the  coffee  could  be  strange  and  undrinkable  . 	0.3125
It  just  did  n't  make  sense  . 	0.0001
Well  , 	0.0001
it  still  does  n't  make  sense  , 	0.125
but  it  certainly  happened  with  the  coffee 	0.0001
I  made  using  the  Kona  pods  also  . 	0.0001
My  results  were  overall  poor  and  it  was  very  disappointing  as  the  Kona  pods  cost  a  lot  more  than  Folgers  or  other  pod  brands  that  I  can  buy  locally  . 	0.28125
The  first  thing  I  noticed  was  that  the  coffee  in  the  2  cup  sized  Kona  pods  is  packed  in  much 	0.125
more  tightly  than  in  any  other  pod 	0.625
I  have  ever  used  in  my  Senseo  . 	0.0001
The  instructions  for  the  Kona  pods  say 	0.0001
to  wiggle  the  pods  to  break  up  the  coffee  before  inserting  into  the  machine  . 	0.125
The  Kona  pods  feel  very  hard 	0.20833333333333331
when  taken  out  of  their  package  . 	0.0001
I  always  wiggled  and  jiggled  the  pods  for  about  10  seconds 	0.0001
before  putting  them  in  the  Senseo  . 	0.0001
After  my  problems  with  the  Kona  pods  , 	0.625
my  husband  decided  that  I  was  not  '  wiggling  ' 	0.375
them  enough  . 	0.0001
He  promptly  wiggled  one  to  the  point  that  it  broke  open  . 	0.25
So  , 	0.0001
there  is  just  so  much 	0.125
that  can  be  done  to  the  pod 	0.125
before  putting  it  in  the  machine  . 	0.0001
The  first  thing  that  I  noticed  was  that  the  amount  of  coffee 	0.125
brewed 	0.0001
when  using  the  Kona  pod  was  quite  a  bit  less  than  when  using  2  smaller  pods  . 	0.3125
That  did  not  make  much  sense  , 	0.625
but  after  several  cups  of  Kona  , 	0.0001
it  was  obvious 	0.125
that  there  was  never  the  amount  of  coffee 	0.375
coming  out  as  before  when  using  2  small  one  cup  pods  . 	0.375
The  best  I  can  figure  out  is  that  the  Kona  pods 	0.125
themselves  seem  to  '  hold  '  a  lot  more  water  . 	0.0001
There  is  more  water 	0.125
that  remains  in  the  pod  itself 	0.0001
after  the  brewing  is  done  . 	0.125
The  pod  itself  is  heavier 	0.125
when  I  take 	0.0001
it  out  to  throw  it  away  . 	0.0001
So  , 	0.0001
I  believe 	0.0001
the  reason 	0.0001
that  there  is  less  actual  coffee  using  Kona  pods  is  that  the  pods  themselves  retain  a  lot  more  water 	0.3125
and  it  can  not  pass  through  into  the  coffee  cup  . 	0.625
Then  , 	0.0001
as  others  have  mentioned  , 	0.0001
there  is  the  problem 	0.375
that  happens  to  me  about  1\/2  the  time 	0.0001
when  using  the  Kona  pods  . 	0.0001
The  problem  is  that  for  whatever  reason  , 	0.375
the  water  does  not  actually  go  through 	0.625
and  penetrate  the  Kona  pods  during  the  brewing  cycle  . 	0.0001
The  '  coffee  ' 	0.0001
that  is  supposed  to  be  coming  out  of  the  spout  is  just  water  ! 	0.125
This  problem  is  one  that  I  still  can  not  really  figure  out  . 	0.375
The  Kona  pods  are  a  little  smaller  in  diameter  than  all  the  other  pods 	0.375
I  have  tried  . 	0.0001
So  , 	0.0001
I  guess  that  somehow  the  water  has  enough  room  to  '  go  around  '  the  actual  pod 	0.5
and  come  out  of  the  spout  without  '  going  through  '  the  pod 	0.0001
to  brew  coffee  . 	0.0001
I  also  wonder  if  the  paper  filter  of  the  Kona  pods  is  different  than  other  pods 	0.375
and  for  some  reason  the  Kona  paper  is  more  difficult  for  water 	0.4375
to  penetrate  . 	0.0001
I  have  tried 	0.0001
wetting  the  Kona  pod  paper  filter  right  before  starting  to  brew  the  coffee 	0.0001
thinking  that  perhaps  it  would  help  the  water 	0.0001
to  penetrate  the  paper  and  pod  . 	0.0001
But  ,  that  has  not  worked  for  me  . 	0.625
So  , 	0.0001
it  is  back  to  regular  more  reasonably  priced  coffee  pods  for  me  . 	0.1875
I  have  wasted  too  many  expensive  Kona  pods  trying  to  get  a  proper  cup  of  coffee  from  them  . 	0.25
Even  when  the  Kona  pods  brew  a  cup  of  coffee  , 	0.0001
it  is  not  as  large  of  an  amount  of  coffee  as  I  get 	0.2916666666666667
using  other  brands  . 	0.625
So  , 	0.0001
adding  the  cost  of  the  Kona  pods  to  the  fact 	0.0001
that  it  brews  a  smaller  amount  of  coffee  equals  a  product 	0.375
that  is  way  too  expensive 	0.1875
when  it  does  actually  work  . 	0.0001
I  have  been  reading  of  a  product 	0.125
called  an  EcoPod  . 	0.0001
It  is  a  refillable  pod  for  these  type  of  coffeemakers  . 	0.125
It  might  be  the  next  thing 	0.125
I  try  . 	0.0001
