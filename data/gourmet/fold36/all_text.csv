16_gourmet_neg_1	I purchased this flour a few weeks ago and just baked with it the first time yesterday .
16_gourmet_neg_2	I was very satisfied with the taste and texture of it .
16_gourmet_neg_3	However ,
16_gourmet_neg_4	I can not tolerate gluten or rice
16_gourmet_neg_5	and after eating some of what I had baked ,
16_gourmet_neg_6	I had an allergic reaction .
16_gourmet_neg_7	I called the company and they could not tell me anything in regards to their mills
16_gourmet_neg_8	nor if there could be any cross-contamination .
16_gourmet_neg_9	The lady on the phone seemed to think
16_gourmet_neg_10	that the mills are shared equipment
16_gourmet_neg_11	and that no precautions are taken
16_gourmet_neg_12	to avoid cross-contamination .
16_gourmet_neg_13	If you ` re buying it for low-carb prep only ,
16_gourmet_neg_14	it should be a good flour at a great deal .
16_gourmet_neg_15	Please beware if you are using
16_gourmet_neg_16	it
16_gourmet_neg_17	to avoid gluten or other allergenic grains
