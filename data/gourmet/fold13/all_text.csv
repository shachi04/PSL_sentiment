13_gourmet_pos_1	The Easy Sprouter is a great vertical sprouter .
13_gourmet_pos_2	The seeds or beans go into an inner cup with drainage holes .
13_gourmet_pos_3	The inner cup sets in the outer cup
13_gourmet_pos_4	which catches any dripping water
13_gourmet_pos_5	and still allows air circulation around the inner cup on all sides .
13_gourmet_pos_6	Maintaining your growing sprouts
13_gourmet_pos_7	-LRB- for most seed types -RRB-
13_gourmet_pos_8	means
13_gourmet_pos_9	holding the inner cup under running water for at least thirty seconds ,
13_gourmet_pos_10	allowing excess water
13_gourmet_pos_11	to drain off ,
13_gourmet_pos_12	and setting the inner cup back in the outer cup .
13_gourmet_pos_13	Doing this two or three times a day makes sure
13_gourmet_pos_14	that the growing sprouts remain fresh enough
13_gourmet_pos_15	to avoid spoiling ,
13_gourmet_pos_16	moist enough not to dry out ,
13_gourmet_pos_17	but never remaining in standing water .
13_gourmet_pos_18	Most seeds need to be pre-soaked initially , and this step can be managed directly in the Easy Sprouter .
13_gourmet_pos_19	There are three lids : two lock into place - one with air holes , one without .
13_gourmet_pos_20	The third is domed ,
13_gourmet_pos_21	but does n't actually lock onto the cup .
13_gourmet_pos_22	By comparison ,
13_gourmet_pos_23	sprouting in canning jars requires the jar to be filled and emptied several times with each rinsing ,
13_gourmet_pos_24	and draining sufficiently is not always easy .
13_gourmet_pos_25	The Sprout Master ,
13_gourmet_pos_26	which is another sprouting tray
13_gourmet_pos_27	I love , allows similar rinsing ,
13_gourmet_pos_28	but the seeds must be soaked in a different container
13_gourmet_pos_29	and then transfered to the Sprout Master .
13_gourmet_pos_30	The Sprout Master allows the growing plants slightly more light
13_gourmet_pos_31	because it has width
13_gourmet_pos_32	rather than height ,
13_gourmet_pos_33	but the difference is slight .
13_gourmet_pos_34	I ` ve mostly used my Easy Sprouter for leafy sprout salad mixes
13_gourmet_pos_35	-LRB- alfalfa , clover , etc . . . -RRB-
13_gourmet_pos_36	These varieties take about a week to grow .
13_gourmet_pos_37	With the variety of lids the sprouter
13_gourmet_pos_38	it is very flexible .
13_gourmet_pos_39	I have n't tried to sprout
13_gourmet_pos_40	while traveling ,
13_gourmet_pos_41	but I 'm confident
13_gourmet_pos_42	that it would work well .
13_gourmet_pos_43	It works for storing your grown sprouts in the fridge as advertised ,
13_gourmet_pos_44	but I usually take them out of the sprouter
13_gourmet_pos_45	and break up the clumps before serving and put any left-overs into a different container .
13_gourmet_pos_46	I use my Easy Sprouter nearly constantly , along with my Sprout Master mini trays .
13_gourmet_pos_47	I currently have a second Easy Sprouter on order
