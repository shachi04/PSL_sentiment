 10_cell_neg_2	negative	0.0001	0.4375	I  had  mixed  emotions  for  the  product  . 
 10_cell_neg_3	positive	0.0001	0.5	On  one  hand  , 
 10_cell_neg_4	positive	0.25	0.5625	the  black  finish  looked  very  nice  , 
 10_cell_neg_5	positive	0.75	0.5	and  the  clear  plastic  covering  protected  the  screen 
 10_cell_neg_6	positive	0.16666666666666666	0.4375	but  was  still  easy  to  read  . 
 10_cell_neg_7	positive	0.20833333333333334	0.3333333333333333	Also  ,  all  of  the  side  buttons  are  fairly  easy  to  reach  with  average-sized  fingers 
 10_cell_neg_8	negative	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB-  except  maybe  the  camera  button  -RRB-  , 
 10_cell_neg_9	positive	0.1875	0.3333333333333333	so  navigating  the  phone  with  the  cover  still  closed  is  pretty  easy 
 10_cell_neg_10	negative	0.25	0.25	unless  you  need 
 10_cell_neg_11	negative	0.375	0.0001	to  use  touch  functions  or  open  the  QWERTY  keyboard  . 
 10_cell_neg_12	negative	0.2916666666666667	0.28125	However  ,  due  to  the  padding  and  the  nature  of  the  metal  materials  ,  the  case  is  very  thick  and  bulky  - 
 10_cell_neg_13	negative	0.0001	0.0001	when  using  the  belt  clip  ,  the  phone  sticks  out  far 
 10_cell_neg_14	negative	0.625	0.125	enough  that  it  does  not  even  rest  evenly  on  your  hip  , 
 10_cell_neg_15	negative	0.0001	0.0001	but  leans  at  an  angle  . 
 10_cell_neg_16	negative	0.125	0.3125	BUT  ,  the  deciding  factor  in  my  two-star  rating  is  that  this  case  was  the  cause  of  the  only  two  times  I  have  dropped  my  Cingular  8525  -LRB- 
 10_cell_neg_17	negative	0.375	0.25	which  at  such  a  steep  price  ,  is  not  something 
 10_cell_neg_18	negative	0.0001	0.125	I  like  to  drop  -RRB-  . 
 10_cell_neg_19	negative	0.625	0.0001	The  problem  lies  with  the  snap-shut  system 
 10_cell_neg_20	negative	0.0001	0.0001	that  closes  the  case  . 
 10_cell_neg_21	negative	0.125	0.25	Because  the  metal  is  so  thin  , 
 10_cell_neg_22	negative	0.4375	0.2916666666666667	it  does  not  secure  very  well  , 
 10_cell_neg_23	negative	0.375	0.25	and  can  come  open  pretty  easily  . 
 10_cell_neg_24	negative	0.125	0.0001	To  fix  this  , 
 10_cell_neg_25	negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  simply  bent  the  piece  of  metal  downward  and  towards  the  phone  , 
 10_cell_neg_26	negative	0.4166666666666667	0.1875	so  that  it  was  much  harder  to  both  open  and  close  the  case  . 
 10_cell_neg_27	positive	0.625	0.0001	This  ,  for  the  most  part  ,  solves  the  problem  , 
 10_cell_neg_28	negative	0.3333333333333333	0.25	but  it  is  still  dangerous 
 10_cell_neg_29	negative	0.125	0.3125	and  caution  is  DEFINATELY  in  order  . 
 10_cell_neg_30	positive	0.125	0.25	My  favorite  thing  about  this  case  is  that  you  can  open  the  case 
 10_cell_neg_31	positive	0.375	0.375	and  slide  the  keyboard  open  without  actually  taking  the  phone  out  of  the  case  . 
 10_cell_neg_32	positive	0.125	0.5625	This  is  nice 
 10_cell_neg_33	positive	0.0001	0.0001	because  it  enable  quick  replies  to  text  messages  . 
 10_cell_neg_34	positive	0.125	0.25	This  is  the  only  reason 
 10_cell_neg_35	negative	0.375	0.0001	I  did  not  give  it  a  one-star  rating  . 
 10_cell_neg_36	negative	0.1875	0.1875	I  am  currently  looking  for  a  soft  case  ,  preferably  a  leather  sleeve  case  that  I  can  just  pull  my  phone  out  of  off  of  my  hip  , 
 10_cell_neg_37	negative	0.5	0.5	rather  than  bother  with  a  clip  anymore  . 
 10_cell_neg_38	negative	0.125	0.0001	As  a  final  warning  -  BE

 10_cell_neg_40	negative	0.0001	0.625	Plus  , 
 10_cell_neg_41	negative	0.625	0.1875	I  seriously  do  not  believe 
 10_cell_neg_42	negative	0.125	0.3125	it  is  worth  its  steep  price  point 
 2_cell_pos_1	positive	0.1875	0.375	I  think  this  is  a  pretty  good  earpiece  .  .  .
