negative	0.75	0.0001	It  's  simply  a  poorly  architected  database  . 
negative	0.125	0.3333333333333333	-  The  user  interface  for  entering  a  new  contact  is  rudimentary 
negative	0.125	0.25	-LRB-  as  are  all  dialog  windows  on  this  device  .  -RRB- 
negative	0.1875	0.3125	-  One  of  the  most  annoying  aspects  of  this  device  is  the  alarm  clock  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	The  user  interface  looks  like  it  was  written  in  10  minutes 
negative	0.3333333333333333	0.4375	and  was  clearly  not  verified  for  correctness  . 
negative	0.25	0.20833333333333331	The  digital  watch  I  had  in  1982  had  the  same  degree  of  sophistication 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	but  with  a  more  intuitive  use  model 
negative	0.125	0.4375	and  was  more  thoroughly  debugged  . 
negative	0.1875	0.25	First  of  all  ,  the  user  only  gets  to  select  a  time  and  if  the  alarm  is  on  or  off  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	From  the  interface 
negative	0.3125	0.375	you  would  assume  you  could  only  set  a  single  alarm  .  .  . 
negative	0.125	0.375	if  only  it  were  that  obvious  . 
negative	0.125	0.4166666666666667	The  best  way  to  explain  this  buggy  piece  of  software  is  with  an  example  : 
negative	0.25	0.375	I  set  the  alarm  for  6am  ; 
negative	0.25	0.375	the  next  day  the  alarm  goes  off  at  6am  . 
negative	0.25	0.375	That  day  I  set  the  alarm  for  7am  - 
negative	0.25	0.375	the  following  day  the  alarm  goes  off  at  6am  and  7am  . 
negative	0.25	0.25	The  next  day  I  set  the  alarm  for  7:30  am  and  you  guessed  it  , 
negative	0.25	0.4375	the  alarm  now  goes  off  three  times  . 
negative	0.125	0.375	The  best  that  I  `  ve  been  able  to  deduce 
negative	0.0001	0.25	-LRB-  of  course  ,  this  type  of  behavior 
negative	0.375	0.1875	is  not  documented  in  the  user  manual 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	that  comes  with  the  device  -RRB- 
negative	0.125	0.3333333333333333	"is  that  the  user  has  to  actively  select  ""  off  ""  for  the  current  setting "
negative	0.0001	0.375	"before  setting  ""  on  ""  for  the  new  time  . "
negative	0.175	0.296875	But  there  is  no  indication  of  what  alarms  are  set  ,  so  after  a  while  or  a  particularly  busy  week  you  can  loose  track  of  what  's  set  and  what  is  n't  .  .  .  the  only  way  to  clear  all  of  the  alarms 
negative	0.3333333333333333	0.25	that  have  been  set  is  a  hard  re-boot  . 
negative	0.125	0.3125	-  The  calculator  is  a  joke  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	If  this  took  an  engineer  10  minutes  to  write  they  should  be  fired  . 
negative	0.0001	0.625	A  calculator  watch  in  the  '  80  's  had  more  sophisticated  features  . 
negative	0.375	0.25	The  user  interface  is  so  bad 
negative	0.75	0.0001	it  's  hard  to  describe  it  in  words  . 
negative	0.625	0.5	-  Microsoft  truly  does  not  understand 
negative	0.0001	0.125	how  a  user  would  like  to  use  the  device 
negative	0.25	0.0001	and  instead  insists  on  using  the  same  usage  model 
negative	0.625	0.0001	that  they  `  ve  inflicted  upon  us  since  Windows  95  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	Most  features  or  function  have  to  be  navigated  through  the  Start  menu  button  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	Applications  are  nested  and  features  are  hidden  behind  several  annoying  menu  selections  . 
negative	0.125	0.1875	Some  features  are  simply  hard  to  find  , 
negative	0.0001	0.625	but  should  it  really  take  so  many  menu  selections 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  find  common  tools  or  applications  ? 
negative	0.16666666666666666	0.2916666666666667	-  The  use  of  alarms  or  reminders  is  ambiguous  - 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	"to  put  the  device  in  ""  Silent  ""  mode  , "
negative	0.25	0.375	but  leave  alarms  on 
negative	0.1875	0.2916666666666667	because  you  want  to  sleep  and  only  want  your  alarm  to  wake 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	you

negative	0.3125	0.3125	Calendar  reminders  will  be  active 
negative	0.1875	0.3125	as  they  are  assigned  the  alarm  property  instead  of  their  own  or  the  notification  property  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	The  only  way  around  this  is  to  cancel  reminders  for  all  day  events  .  .  . 
negative	0.125	0.5	otherwise 
negative	0.25	0.25	you  get  an  alarm  at  midnight  .

negative	0.125	0.25	On  my  Blackberry  this  was  automatic  ,

positive	0.0001	0.5	Comparable  to  the  8610  as  far  as  I  can  tell  , 
positive	0.125	0.5	which  was  also  good 
positive	0.375	0.375	-LRB-  my  old  Kyocera  ,  on  the  other  hand  ,  was  garbage  -RRB-  .

positive	0.0001	0.4375	-  Good  library  of  games  ,  ringtones  ,  and  graphics  available  . 
positive	0.0001	0.25	Now  I  actually  have  something  to  spend  all  that  balance  on  .  .  .

positive	0.0001	0.3125	No  annual  contract  as  well  ,

negative	0.0001	0.125	On  the  downside  :

negative	0.125	0.3125	They  are  a  bit  stiff  as  well  , 
positive	0.375	0.5	which  is  good  and  bad 
positive	0.0001	0.75	-LRB-  good

negative	0.4375	0.25	because  typing  is  more  of  a  pain  -RRB-  . 
positive	0.25	0.25	-  Virgin  's  web  browser  is  lame  .

negative	0.0001	0.0001	-  No  bluetooth  built-in  , 
negative	0.16666666666666666	0.25	though  this  is  to  be  expected  . 
negative	0.1875	0.25	-  No  camera  either  ,  also  to  be  expected  . 
positive	0.125	0.4583333333333333	This  can  actually  be  a  good  thing  , 
positive	0.125	0.25	since  camera  phones  are  off-limits 
positive	0.25	0.25	in  more  areas  than  you  might  expect  . 
positive	0.125	0.0001	Bottom  line  : 
positive	0.125	0.25	this  handset  is  great  for  the  price  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	There  are  flaws  with  it  ,  as  with  any  phone  ,

positive	0.4375	0.0001	I  `  ve  seen  many  reviewers  complain  about  both  Virgin  and  the  phone  , 
positive	0.625	0.0001	but  in  my  professional  opinion 
positive	0.375	0.25	-LRB-  and  it  is  an  expert  opinion  -RRB- 
positive	0.25	0.25	these  people  need

positive	0.125	0.1875	Considering  the  costs  ,  the  Slice  is  an  great  handset  with  excellent  service  ,

positive	0.0001	0.0001	Moreover  , 
positive	0.0001	0.375	I  really  like  how  the  litter  has  the  capacity  to  absorb  and  prevent  odor

positive	0.0001	0.125	before  my  cat  even  uses  his  litter  box  .

positive	0.625	0.1875	If  you  have  more  than  one  cat  the  manufacturer  does  recommend  ,  not  surprisingly  ,

positive	0.5	0.0001	-LRB-  I  change  mine  about  twice  a  week  just  for  my  cat  's  comfort  .  -RRB-

positive	0.0001	0.625	We  used  this  toaster  oven  a  lot 
positive	0.25	0.3125	because  it  cooked  very  well  . 
positive	0.125	0.4375	Toast  was  perfect  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  the  oven 
positive	0.0001	0.875	cooked  nice  and  hot  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	We  broiled  meats 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  made  all  kind  of  things  in  it  . 
negative	0.125	0.125	We  found  it  hard  to  clean  .

negative	0.125	0.0001	to  clean  those  , 
negative	0.125	0.375	but  it  would  take  a  lot  of  scrubbing  to  clean  the  glass  and  interior  of  the  oven  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Then  after  about  1  year  one  of  the  plastic  feet  broke  off 
negative	0.0001	0.125	when  simply  adjusting  the  position  of  the  oven  on  the  counter  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  glued 
negative	0.0001	0.375	it  back  on  with  super  glue  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	It  broke  again 
negative	0.125	0.375	and  seemed  to  become  more  brittle  over  time  because  of  the  heat  so  I  had  to  fix  this  plastic  foot  a  few  times  . 
negative	0.625	0.0001	Then  another  problem  arose  . 
negative	0.0001	0.625	The  toaster  and  the  one  light  would  shut  off  a  few  second  after  pressing  start  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	So  to  make  toast 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	we  just  used  the  un-timed  bake  function  , 
negative	0.375	0.1875	but  then  we  would  have  to  watch  so  we  did  not  burn  the  toast  . 
negative	0.125	0.0001	Still  we  lived  with  it  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Then  after  about  another  four  months  all  of  the  controls  stopped  working  . 
negative	0.625	0.0001	So  it  does  not  bake  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  think 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  knew 
negative	0.125	0.25	this  was  going  to  happen 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	because  I  would  hear  a  strange  buzz 
negative	0.375	0.0001	and  see  a  little  smoke  come  off 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	when  ever  I  turned  the  dial 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  bake  for  a  while  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	So  therefore  I  think 
negative	0.45	0.25	the  electrical  wiring  was  not  heavy  duty  enough  or  the  electrical  system  was  not  soldered  well  or  protected  well  enough  to  last  . 
negative	0.25	0.4375	I  would  have  expected  better  quality  . 
negative	0.125	0.3125	Considering  how  long  we  have  been  making  toaster  ovens  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  think 
negative	0.28125	0.2	that  it  would  have  not  been  too  hard  for  them  to  have  made  a  more  heavy  duty  electrical  system  for  the  controls  . 
positive	0.625	0.125	So  like  other  reviews  say  , 
positive	0.0001	0.375	it  does  cook  well  and  evenly  , 
negative	0.25	0.1875	but  it  is  hard  to  clean  and  does  not  last  . 
positive	0.28125	0.21875	If  I  were  to  have  rated  the  product  before  the  problems  started  I  would  have  given  it  4  stars  . 
negative	0.375	0.15	I  wish  that  Amazon  and  these  sites  had  a  section  for  long  term  reviews 
negative	0.25	0.25	that  would  rate  the  quality  , 
negative	0.125	0.1875	because  most  of  the  reviews  seem  to  be  written  soon  after  receiving  the  products  . 
negative	0.125	0.4375	We  are  now  looking  into  T-Fall  Convection  Toaster  oven  , 
negative	0.0001	0.125	but  after  reading  those  reviews 
positive	0.625	0.0001	we  do  not  know  if  it  cooks  as  hot  as  this  oven

negative	0.0001	0.0001	______________ 
negative	0.0001	0.125	Since  writing  my  review  above 
negative	0.125	0.0001	I  tried  to  fix  my  oven  to  no  avail  , 
negative	0.0001	0.25	but  I  have  gained  more  insight  into  its  design 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  perhaps 
negative	0.125	0.25	why  it  broke  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	My  recommendations  are  as  follows  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Since  I  know 
negative	0.125	0.5	"that  the  rotary  controls  and  the  circuit  board  of  this  ""  Classic  ""  model  product  can  over  time  get  dirty  and  stop  working  , "
negative	0.375	0.0001	I  recommend  that  people  who  own  this  oven  keep  it  far  away  from  any  other  cooking  products 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	that  create  grease  or  steam  such  as  range  tops  ,  rice  cookers  ,  deep  fryers  ,  pressure  cookers  ,  or  kitchen  sinks  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Especially  keep  the  vents  near  the  controls  on  the  right  side  of  this  unit  away  from  these  sources  of  moisture  and  grease  . 
negative	0.125	0.20833333333333331	I  recommend  consumers  to  consider  the  newer  models  with  digital  controls  , 
negative	0.0001	0.4375	which  might  have  a  different  mechanism  inside  or  the  models  with  the  controls  beneath 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  therefore  the  electrical  components 
negative	0.625	0.125	and  cooling  vents  underneath  the  oven  and  not  in  an  exposed  location  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	This  might  make  the  unit  last  longer  . 
negative	0.375	0.275	The  newer  Cuisinart  models  with  the  knobs  or  digital  controls  beneath  the  oven  might  be  a  design  improvement  to  correct  the  sort  of  problem 
negative	0.0001	0.25	I  had  . 
negative	0.625	0.25	Or  perhaps  other  manufactures  have  solved  electrical  component  problem  other  ways  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	Maybe  1.5  years  is  average  life  ,  or  maybe  the  fact 
positive	0.25	0.1875	that  my  oven  was  placed  near  the  cooking  range  in  my  kitchen 
positive	0.0001	0.5	made  my  unit  more  susceptible  to  malfunction  . 
negative	0.4375	0.25	Reviews  of  lots  of  other  brand  models  show  short  life  spans  for  these  products  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	From  the  reviews  and  my  observations  above  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  think 
negative	0.0001	0.375	the  Krups  models  and  the  improved  Cuisinart  models  might  last  a  longer  time  than  this  classic  model
