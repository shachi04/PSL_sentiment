12_gourmet_pos_2	Tazo 's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo 's Zen ,
12_gourmet_pos_3	and I liked
12_gourmet_pos_4	"that it does n't contain Tazo 's omnipresent "" natural flavors """
12_gourmet_pos_5	that almost all of their other teas contain ,
12_gourmet_pos_6	which to me is not an advantage .
12_gourmet_pos_7	"I like a natural , real taste with real ingredients sans vague "" natural flavors """
12_gourmet_pos_8	and sans flavorings , sans essences , etc .
12_gourmet_pos_9	China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner , purer way than Tazo 's other teas .
12_gourmet_pos_10	I liked this green tea !
12_gourmet_pos_11	The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China .
12_gourmet_pos_12	It contains caffeine .
12_gourmet_pos_13	Tazo is an interesting company
12_gourmet_pos_14	that makes only super premium teas .
12_gourmet_pos_15	They are socially responsible ,
12_gourmet_pos_16	"based in Portland , and have the motto , "" The Reincarnation of Tea "" ."
12_gourmet_pos_17	Tazo is owned by Starbucks .
12_gourmet_pos_18	Their web site is fun and quirky , with a Zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out .
12_gourmet_pos_19	It is unclear ,
12_gourmet_pos_20	though , from their web site ,
12_gourmet_pos_21	how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher ,
12_gourmet_pos_22	"and they do use some "" natural flavors """
12_gourmet_pos_23	in their teas
12_gourmet_pos_24	--
12_gourmet_pos_25	this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea .
12_gourmet_pos_26	"China Green Tips has none of these "" natural flavors """
12_gourmet_pos_27	and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience .
12_gourmet_pos_28	On the paper tea packet ,
12_gourmet_pos_29	Tazo writes ,
12_gourmet_pos_30	"a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor . """
12_gourmet_pos_31	This is the perfect way to describe this tea !
12_gourmet_pos_32	"On their web site , Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as "" grassy , vegetative , sweet , ricey "" ."
12_gourmet_pos_33	"Tazo describes the aroma as "" vegetative , popcorn "" ."
12_gourmet_pos_34	I would rate this tea , and Tazo in general , as very good -- better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings --
12_gourmet_pos_35	but not as good as Numi or Aspen .
12_gourmet_pos_36	Still , this tea is excellent , so I 'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas
12_gourmet_pos_37	and giving it five stars .
12_gourmet_pos_38	If you enjoy super premium teas ,
12_gourmet_pos_39	and are stuck with Tazo for some reason , choose China Green Tips
12_gourmet_pos_40	and you will be quite satisfied .
12_gourmet_pos_41	I ca n't honestly say that
12_gourmet_pos_42	about any other Tazo tea .
