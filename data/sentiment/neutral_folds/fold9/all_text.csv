14_cell_neg_1	 The  phone  is  great  .  . 
14_cell_neg_2	 and  I  knew 
14_cell_neg_3	 it  would  be  . 
14_cell_neg_4	 And  I  am  a  devoted  Amazon  shopper  . 
14_cell_neg_5	 My  concern  was  always  whether  Amazon  was  up  to  the  daunting  task  of  selling  cell  phones  and  service  plans  .  .  . 
14_cell_neg_6	 a  concern 
14_cell_neg_7	 that  has  proved  well  founded  . 
14_cell_neg_8	 I  was  originally  concerned 
14_cell_neg_9	 because  of  feedback 
14_cell_neg_10	 I  had  read  on  this  site 
14_cell_neg_11	" ""indicating  the  Pearl  """"  shipped  hot  ,  """"  with  an  active  SIM  ,"" "
14_cell_neg_12	 which  meant  for  those 
14_cell_neg_13	 that  --  like  me  -  were  upgrading 
14_cell_neg_14	 -LRB-  vs  .  new  service  -RRB-  , 
14_cell_neg_15	 their  existing  phone  would  stop  working 
14_cell_neg_16	 while  the  new  phone  was  en  route  . 
14_cell_neg_17	 To  be  fair  , 
14_cell_neg_18	 that  did  NOT  happen  ;  however  , 
14_cell_neg_19	 I  received  the  Pearl  with  a  SIM  card  that  the  phone  would  not  accept  . 
14_cell_neg_20	 The  instructions 
14_cell_neg_21	 that  are  sent  with  the  phone  say 
14_cell_neg_22	 that  all  you  have  to  do  is  insert  the  SIM  ,  turn  on  the  phone  , 
14_cell_neg_23	 and  it  will  work  . 
14_cell_neg_24	 And  , 
14_cell_neg_25	 if  it  does  n't  work  , 
14_cell_neg_26	 it  says  , 
14_cell_neg_27	 do  n't  call  Cingular  ,  call  Amazon  . 
14_cell_neg_28	 I  followed  the  instructions 
14_cell_neg_29	 --  phone  did  n't  work  , 
14_cell_neg_30	 I  called  Amazon  , 
14_cell_neg_31	 at  which  point  the  CSR  told  me 
14_cell_neg_32	 that  he  had  all  my  information  and  someone  would  be  contacting  me  in  48  HOURS  !  !  ! 
14_cell_neg_33	 Unfortunately  , 
14_cell_neg_34	 I  let  the  poor  guy  have  it  .  .  . 
14_cell_neg_35	 I  told  him  what  I  truly  believe  , 
14_cell_neg_36	 which  is  that  it  is  COMPLETELY  unacceptable  to  tell  me 
14_cell_neg_37	 I  have  to  wait  2  days  just  to  talk  to  someone  about 
14_cell_neg_38	 why  my  phone  - 
14_cell_neg_39	 which  is  supposed  to  work  out  of  the  box  --  is  n't  working  . 
14_cell_neg_40	 So  -  5  Stars  for  the  phone 
14_cell_neg_41	 itself  .  .  . 
14_cell_neg_42	 awesome  ! 
14_cell_neg_43	 2  stars  for  Amazon  .  .  . 
14_cell_neg_44	 they  do  NOT  have  the  kinks 
14_cell_neg_45	 worked  out  yet  . 
14_cell_neg_46	 On  a  positive  note  -- 
14_cell_neg_47	 I  immediately  called  Cingular  , 
14_cell_neg_48	 and  they  resolved  the  problem  for  me  on  the  spot 
14_cell_neg_49	 -LRB-  SIM  was  not  activated  \/  in  the  system  -RRB- 
4_cell_neg_1	 My  problems  with  nextel  did  not  stop 
4_cell_neg_2	 when  I  canceled  my  service  . 
4_cell_neg_3	 I  will  get  to  the  problems  with  the  service  . 
4_cell_neg_4	 When  I  went  to  get  a  new  phone  a  day 
4_cell_neg_5	 before  my  contract  expired  , 
4_cell_neg_6	 I  of  course  wanted  to  keep  my  number  . 
4_cell_neg_7	 So  as  I  went  to  get  my  Cingular  phone 
4_cell_neg_8	 -LRB-  highly  recommended  -RRB-  , 
4_cell_neg_9	 I  had  the  old  number 
4_cell_neg_10	 switched  to  my  new  number  . 
4_cell_neg_11	 Today  , 
4_cell_neg_12	 I  get  in  the  mail  my  nextel  statement  for  the  month  with  a  $  200  early  termination  even  though  I  had  not  canceled  my  service  , 
4_cell_neg_13	 but  had  simply  got  a  new  phone 
4_cell_neg_14	 and  switched  my  number  over  . 
4_cell_neg_15	 This  was  on  icing  on  the  cake 
4_cell_neg_16	 after  2  years  of  absolutely  amazingy  bad  service  from  nextel  . 
4_cell_neg_17	 In  my  town  ,  not  a  small  town  by  any  means  , 
4_cell_neg_18	 there  are  very  few  places 
4_cell_neg_19	 that  have  any  service  . 
4_cell_neg_20	 In  the  largest  subdivision  , 
4_cell_neg_21	 you  can  not  get  service  anywhere  . 
4_cell_neg_22	 I  constantly  get  comments  from  people 
4_cell_neg_23	trying
4_cell_neg_24	 to  reach  me 
4_cell_neg_25	 that  get  the  classic  nextel  line  .  .  . 
4_cell_neg_26	 Please  hold 
4_cell_neg_27	 while  the  nextel  subscriber  you  are  trying  to  reach  is  located  . 
4_cell_neg_28	 Most  of  the  time  I  would  not  even  recieve  incoming  calls  ,  calls  would  go  straight  to  my  voice  mail  . 
4_cell_neg_29	 Not  only  would  I  not  get  the  calls  , 
4_cell_neg_30	 but  often  I  would  not  even  get  the  voice  mails  until  days  or  even  weeks  later  . 
4_cell_neg_31	 When  I  did  actually  take  calls 
4_cell_neg_32	 -LRB-  and  call  out  -RRB-  , 
4_cell_neg_33	 I  can  not  count  the  number  of  times 
4_cell_neg_34	 I  `  ve  had  my  call 
4_cell_neg_35	 dropped  . 
4_cell_neg_36	 I  recieved  so  many  different  error  messages  sometimes 
4_cell_neg_37	 I  wonder  if  they  just  spend  all  their  time  at  nextel  thinking  of  different  error  messages  to  program  into  their  phones  . 
4_cell_neg_38	 That  brings 
4_cell_neg_39	 me  to  the  selling  point  of  nextel  ,  the  famed  and  well-loved  direct  connect  feature  . 
4_cell_neg_40	 This  is  an  absolute  joke  . 
4_cell_neg_41	 Direct  connect  only  works  MAYBE  half  the  time 
4_cell_neg_42	 I  tried  to  use  it  . 
4_cell_neg_43	 Even  then  ,  in  the  middle  of  the  conversation 
4_cell_neg_44	 I  would  be  greeted  by  the  loud  beep  of  my  phone 
4_cell_neg_45	 telling  me 
4_cell_neg_46	 I  wont  be  talking  to  that  person  anymore  . 
4_cell_neg_47	 Of  course  , 
4_cell_neg_48	 I  would  expect  nothing  less  from  the  nextel  network  . 
4_cell_neg_49	 Text  messaging  with  nextel  is  next  to  impossible  . 
4_cell_neg_50	 If  it  did  not  take  hours 
4_cell_neg_51	 to  send  or  recieve  a  message  , 
4_cell_neg_52	 it  took  days  ,  or  maybe  did  n't  even  come  at  all  . 
4_cell_neg_53	 The  internet  access  was  fine  , 
4_cell_neg_54	 it  the  rare  instance  that  it  worked  . 
4_cell_neg_55	 Of  course  , 
4_cell_neg_56	 when  you  do  n't  have  service  , 
4_cell_neg_57	 you  do  n't  get  the  internet  access  either  . 
4_cell_neg_58	" ""I  was  constantly  getting  the  message  """"  network  not  available  """"  ."" "
4_cell_neg_59	 Calling  and  trying  to  complain  to  nextel  is  futile  . 
4_cell_neg_60	 Trying  to  get  through  to  customer  service  takes  forever 
4_cell_neg_61	 and  once  you  get  through  they  do  nothing  . 
4_cell_neg_62	 My  experience  with  nextel  has  been  nothing  short  of  a  disaster 
4_cell_neg_63	 and  I  write  this  trying  to  warn  anyone 
4_cell_neg_64	 considering  nextel  . 
4_cell_neg_65	 Stick  with  Verizon  or  Cingular  and  you  will  be  much  happier  in  the  end  . 
4_cell_neg_66	 Do  n't  make  the  same  mistake 
4_cell_neg_67	 I  did  . 
3_cell_pos_1	 I  bought  this  phone  as  part  of  the  Sprint\/Nextel  SERO  plan  . 
3_cell_pos_2	 I  used  it  for  about  14  days  before  deciding 
3_cell_pos_3	 that  it  did  n't  fit  my  needs  for  several  reasons 
3_cell_pos_4	 outlined  below  : 
3_cell_pos_5	 -  Battery  life  was  sporadic  -- 
3_cell_pos_6	 I  got  maybe  a  day  worth  of  power  from  it  . 
3_cell_pos_7	 One  time  it  completely 
3_cell_pos_8	 discharged  overnight  . 
3_cell_pos_9	 For  the  price  of  the  phone 
3_cell_pos_10	 -LRB-  and  the  two  year  contract  it  carries  -RRB- 
3_cell_pos_11	 this  is  a  dealbreaker  . 
3_cell_pos_12	 -  The  Nextel  network  coverage  has  gone  downhill  in  my  area 
3_cell_pos_13	 -LRB-  I  was  a  former  Nextel  subscriber  for  3  years 
3_cell_pos_14	-
3_cell_pos_15	 so  I  have  some  experience  with  coverage  around  town  -RRB-  . 
3_cell_pos_16	 I  was  getting  disconnects 
3_cell_pos_17	 and  sporadic  no  signals  . 
3_cell_pos_18	 -  The  phone  would  sporadically  mute  the  ringer  . 
3_cell_pos_19	 An  incoming  call  would  light  up  the  display 
3_cell_pos_20	 but  there  would  be  no  ringing  . 
3_cell_pos_21	 This  seems 
3_cell_pos_22	 to  happen 
3_cell_pos_23	 after  I  had  put  the  phone  on  vibrate 
3_cell_pos_24	 and  then  turned  it  back 
3_cell_pos_25	 to  ring  . 
3_cell_pos_26	 -  For  the  same  monthly  service  fee  , 
3_cell_pos_27	 I  was  getting  less  access  to  web  services  and  no  high  speed  Internet  ability  . 
3_cell_pos_28	 Admittedly  the  high  speed  access  is  not  as  useful  on  a  tiny  screen  -- 
3_cell_pos_29	 but  if  I  'm  going  to  be  locked  into  a  2  year  contract 
3_cell_pos_30	 I  would  like  to  have  some  fast  internet  access  on  the  phone  . 
3_cell_pos_31	 The  i880  still  uses  the  slow  Nextel  data  network  . 
3_cell_pos_32	 I  was  not  a  Direct  Connect\/Walkie  Talkie  user  . 
3_cell_pos_33	 If  I  were  , 
3_cell_pos_34	 then  my  opinion  of  this  phone  might  be  a  little  higher 
3_cell_pos_35	 -LRB-  since  Nextel  presently  has  arguably  the  best  fully  functioning  walkie  talkie  network  -RRB-  . 
3_cell_pos_36	 I  could  not  justify  being  locked  into  a  2  year  contract  with  equipment 
3_cell_pos_37	 that  seemed  sub-par  on  a  network 
3_cell_pos_38	 that  did  not 
3_cell_pos_39	 -LRB-  and  likely  never  will  -RRB-  support  the  latest  high  speed  technologies  . 
3_cell_pos_40	 Below  were  my  initial  impressions  during  the  time  I  used  the  phone  : 
3_cell_pos_41	 Thankfully  Motorola  designed  the  phone 
3_cell_pos_42	 so  the  micro-SD  card  is  accessible  from  the  outside  -- 
3_cell_pos_43	 no  need  to  pull  the  battery 
3_cell_pos_44	 to  update  the  card  . 
3_cell_pos_45	 Here  's  the  big  things 
3_cell_pos_46	 I  do  n't  like  . 
3_cell_pos_47	 1  . 
3_cell_pos_48	 You  CAN  NOT  use  any  mp3  songs 
3_cell_pos_49	 that  you  transfer  to  the  micro-sd  card  as  ringtones  . 
3_cell_pos_50	 2  .  You  also  can  not  readily  load  additional  wallpapers 
3_cell_pos_51	 unless  it  is  a  picture 
3_cell_pos_52	 you  took  with  the  phone  or  a  paid  download  . 
3_cell_pos_53	 Any  message 
3_cell_pos_54	 -LRB-  mms  -RRB- 
3_cell_pos_55	 that  you  send  to  yourself  can  only  be  set  as  a  caller  id  image  and  not  wallpaper  . 
3_cell_pos_56	 3  .  Battery  life  on  my  phone  is  flaky  - 
3_cell_pos_57	 I  'm  getting  maybe  a  day  and  one-half  with  usage 
3_cell_pos_58	 that  approximates  60  minutes  talk  time  and  perhaps  6  to  10  picture  messages  . 
3_cell_pos_59	 You  must  pay  Nextel  to  download  ringtones  . 
3_cell_pos_60	 There  are  some  users 
3_cell_pos_61	 who  have  modified  the  phone 
3_cell_pos_62	 and  reportedly  are  able  to  use  ringtones  off  their  micro-SD  memory  card  -  however  the  process  is  more  technical  than  what  your  average  user  might  want  to  tangle  with  . 
3_cell_pos_63	 Note  : 
3_cell_pos_64	 Sprint  and  Nextel  are  both  owned  by  the  same  company  . 
3_cell_pos_65	 If  you  `  re  making  a  decision  on  Sprint  vs  . 
3_cell_pos_66	 Nextel  , 
3_cell_pos_67	 there  are  only  a  couple  reasons 
3_cell_pos_68	 that  I  can  think  of 
3_cell_pos_69	 to  recommend  Nextel  over  Sprint  . 
3_cell_pos_70	 First  , 
3_cell_pos_71	 if  the  Nextel  coverage  is  better  . 
3_cell_pos_72	 Second  , 
3_cell_pos_73	 if  you  have  a  need 
3_cell_pos_74	 to  use  the  Nextel  Walkie  Talkie  feature  . 
3_cell_pos_75	 The  Sprint  side  of  the  company  features  phones  with  significantly  enhanced  web  browsing  and  higher  speed  data  communications  . 
3_cell_pos_76	 The  Nextel  side  clings  to  the  larger  phones 
3_cell_pos_77	 and  aims  their  services  at  the  industrial\/construction  market  . 
3_cell_pos_78	 For  almost  every  consumer  ,  the  Sprint  side  is  a  better  deal  . 
3_cell_pos_79	 Sprint  in  my  experience  has  better  customer  service 
3_cell_pos_80	 whereas  Nextel  tends  to  transfer  you  endlessly  among  a  variety  of  customer  service  representatives  . 
3_cell_pos_81	 Here  's  my  summary  of  this  phone 
3_cell_pos_82	 after  using  it  about  two  weeks  : 
3_cell_pos_83	 The  Good  : 
3_cell_pos_84	 -  beautiful  speaker  phone 
3_cell_pos_85	 -  compact  design  \/  solid  feel 
3_cell_pos_86	 -2  megapixel  camera  ,  ability  to  capture  movies 
3_cell_pos_87	 -  flip  swings  open 
3_cell_pos_88	 when  you  push  a  button 
3_cell_pos_89	 -  Nextel  sms\/mms  messages  can  now  be  auto-downloaded  - 
3_cell_pos_90	 I  believe 
3_cell_pos_91	 this  is  the  first  Nextel  phone  to  sport  this  feature 
3_cell_pos_92	 -  nice  loud  audio 
3_cell_pos_93	 -  both  Nextel  walkie  talkie  and  DirecTalk  support 
3_cell_pos_94	 The  Bad  : 
3_cell_pos_95	 -  ca  n't  play  ringtones  off  Micro  SD  or  via  any  other  non-Nextel  transfer 
3_cell_pos_96	 -LRB-  Note  : 
3_cell_pos_97	 Technically  some  people  have  been  using 
3_cell_pos_98	 a  Motorola  product  called  webjal  to  make  transfers  with  a  cable  - 
3_cell_pos_99	 but  this  may  be  more  technical 
3_cell_pos_100	 than  the  average  user  would  like  to  tackle  -RRB- 
3_cell_pos_101	 -  Nextel  is  in  my  opinion  on  their  way  out  as  a  carrier  ,  soon  to  be  completely  assimilated  into  the  Sprint  side  of  things  . 
3_cell_pos_102	 While  not  entirely  unexpected  , 
3_cell_pos_103	 it  means  that  Nextel  plans  and  features  are  not  as  attractive  to  non-construction  users 
3_cell_pos_104	 -LRB-  Nextel  's  core  group  -RRB-  . 
3_cell_pos_105	 If  you  want  Mobile  to  Mobile  unlimited  minutes 
3_cell_pos_106	 you  pay  more  versus  most  Sprint  plans 
3_cell_pos_107	 which  include  them  . 
3_cell_pos_108	 Nextel  does  n't  have  the  super  fast  data  speeds  or  network  web  browsing  of  competing  carriers  . 
3_cell_pos_109	 Most  web  browsing  on  Nextel  is  limited  to  character 
3_cell_pos_110	 based  wap  sites 
3_cell_pos_111	 that  both  crawl  along  speedwise  and  present  unexciting  character 
3_cell_pos_112	 based  screens  . 
3_cell_pos_113	 -  the  phone  is  a  little  bigger 
3_cell_pos_114	 that  what  some  have  grown  accustomed  to  . 
3_cell_pos_115	-
3_cell_pos_116	 while  not  phone  related  ,  some  users  in  larger  cities  have  reported 
3_cell_pos_117	 the  iDen  system  is  nearing  capactity  with  a  lot  of  busy  signals  . 
3_cell_pos_118	 -  I  am  only  getting  about  a  day  of  battery  life  - 
3_cell_pos_119	 which  is  extremely  low  . 
8_cell_pos_1	 For  the  $  50  bucks 
8_cell_pos_2	 you  pay  here  , 
8_cell_pos_3	 you  get  the  phone  plus  300  minutes  of  airtime  . 
8_cell_pos_4	 That  's  not  a  bad  deal 
8_cell_pos_5	 considering  if  you  bought  the  phone 
8_cell_pos_6	 itself  elsewhere  , 
8_cell_pos_7	 it  would  be  $  20  bucks  , 
8_cell_pos_8	 and  buying  the  airtime  separately  would  also  total  approximately  $  20  some  odd  bucks  or  so  . 
8_cell_pos_9	 Plus  tax  . 
8_cell_pos_10	 So  cost  works  about  to  be  about  the  same  . 
8_cell_pos_11	 Frankly  , 
8_cell_pos_12	 I  see  no  savings  to  buying  this  phone  on  this  site  versus  elsewhere  . 
8_cell_pos_13	 Regarding  the  sim  card  , 
8_cell_pos_14	 I  noticed  nothing  unusual  or  problematic  about  insertion  . 
8_cell_pos_15	 A  sim  card  is  a  delicate  silicon  apparatus 
8_cell_pos_16	 that  is  highly  susceptible  to  ESD  -  electro  static  discharge  - 
8_cell_pos_17	 just  like  computer  RAM  is  . 
8_cell_pos_18	 ESD  is  probably  the  primary  reason 
8_cell_pos_19	 why  so  many  reviewers  phones  here  have  failed  . 
8_cell_pos_20	 I  'd  bet  every  single  one  of  them  reside  in  geographical  locations 
8_cell_pos_21	 where  the  weather  is  cold  and  snows  . 
8_cell_pos_22	 Before  you  handle  the  sim  card  , 
8_cell_pos_23	" ""you  should  """"  ground  """""" "
8_cell_pos_24	 yourself  by  touching  something  metal  . 
8_cell_pos_25	 Otherwise  you  run  the  risk  of  destroying  the  sim  card  with  ESD  . 
8_cell_pos_26	 The  phone  itself  is  OK  . 
8_cell_pos_27	 It  's  BASIC  . 
8_cell_pos_28	 Emphasis  on  the  basic  . 
8_cell_pos_29	 I  just  transferred  my  mobile  #  from  a  Motorola  V120c  and  notwithstanding  the  annoying  20  polyphonic  ringtones  on  the  c139  ,  about  the  only  edge 
8_cell_pos_30	 the  c139  has  over  the  V120c  is  the  color  display  . 
8_cell_pos_31	 Please  also  note  that  c139  does  not  have  any  kind  of  interface  as  to  a  pc  so  that  means 
8_cell_pos_32	 you  are  stuck  with  the  bundled  ringtones  and  the  wallpaper  . 
8_cell_pos_33	 IMO  ,  Motorola  could  have  added  a  port 
8_cell_pos_34	 to  accomodate  a  USB  interface  to  this  model  . 
8_cell_pos_35	 It  was  short-sighted  and  just  dumb  not  to  considering  the  V120c  -  also  in  the  same  price  range  -  has  such  a  port  . 
8_cell_pos_36	 Voicemail  is  extremely  problematic  to  set  up  at  this  time  . 
8_cell_pos_37	 I  only  just  had  the  phone 
8_cell_pos_38	 activated  on  this  past  Saturday 
8_cell_pos_39	 -LRB-  10/28/06  -RRB- 
8_cell_pos_40	 and  it  took  over  5  hours  for  my  number  to  be  transferred  over  to  the  new  phone  . 
8_cell_pos_41	 Also  , 
8_cell_pos_42	 it  is  an  entirely  new  network  . 
8_cell_pos_43	 In  Southern  California  ,  the  network  this  model  TracFone  uses  is  Cingular  . 
8_cell_pos_44	 Suffice  it  to  say  , 
8_cell_pos_45	 I  followed  all  the  instructions  on  the  website  explicitly  ,  however  Cingular  just  keeps  regurgitating  its  canned  message 
8_cell_pos_46	 that  it  does  n't  recognize  my  number 
8_cell_pos_47	 and  to  input  my  voicemail  number  . 
8_cell_pos_48	 And  around  and  around  it  goes  . 
8_cell_pos_49	 I  anticipate  nothing 
8_cell_pos_50	" ""but  problems  with  """"  technical  support  """""" "
8_cell_pos_51	 when  I  contact  them  . 
8_cell_pos_52	 They  are  very  polite  as  customer  service  reps  ,  however  they  can  barely  speak  or  understand  English  . 
8_cell_pos_53	 I  am 
8_cell_pos_54	 envisioning  hours  of  BS  with  the  call 
8_cell_pos_55	 I  have  to  make 
8_cell_pos_56	 because  past  experience  has  indicated  to  me  that  these  reps  are  not  technical  whatSOever  . 
8_cell_pos_57	 Note  to  Tracfone  : 
8_cell_pos_58	 Customer  service  reps  from  Mexico 
8_cell_pos_59	 who  can  barely  communicate  with  your  American  consumers  are  most  assuredly  NOT  TECH  SUPPORT  . 
8_cell_pos_60	 Also  ,  I  was  n't  overly  impressed  with  the  keypad 
8_cell_pos_61	 where  it  concerns  text  messaging  . 
8_cell_pos_62	 The  V120c  is  actually  more  intuitive  . 
8_cell_pos_63	 It  's  much  easier  to  use  . 
8_cell_pos_64	 But  the  c139  does  have  one  advantage  in  this  regard  - 
8_cell_pos_65	 text  messages  cost  only  0.3  units  versus  on  the  V120c  ,  TracFone  was  deducting  0.5  units  for  each  incoming  and  outgoing  text  message  . 
8_cell_pos_66	 I  'm  not  sure 
8_cell_pos_67	 why  that  is  considering  the  deduction  of  units  has  zip  to  do  with  the  model  of  the  phone  . 
8_cell_pos_68	 It  should  be  one  uniform  deduction  across  the  board  . 
8_cell_pos_69	 Consumers  should  contact  TracFone  customer  service 
8_cell_pos_70	 and  inquire  about  this  phenomenon  . 
8_cell_pos_71	 Bottom  line  is  that  I  would  recommend  this  phone  to  anyone 
8_cell_pos_72	 who  is  upgrading  from  a  monochromatic  LED  phone 
8_cell_pos_73	 and  wants  an  \*  inexpensive  \*  phone  with  a  much  easier  on  the  eyes  color  display  . 
8_cell_pos_74	 Inexpensive  as  in  you 
8_cell_pos_75	bought
8_cell_pos_76	 it  from  a  retailer  for  $  20  bucks  . 
8_cell_pos_77	 But  if  you  want  pretty  new  ringtones  and  wallpaper  ,  and  a  little  more  flexibility  , 
8_cell_pos_78	 then  get 
8_cell_pos_79	 yourself  a  Nokia  2126  . 
8_cell_pos_80	 For  the  same  money  you  spend  here  ,  the  Nokia  is  a  better  phone  . 
8_cell_pos_81	 It  has  a  USB  port  ,  a  speakerphone  , 
8_cell_pos_82	 plus  other  extras  . 
16_gourmet_neg_1	 I  purchased  this  flour  a  few  weeks  ago  and  just  baked  with  it  the  first  time  yesterday  . 
16_gourmet_neg_2	 I  was  very  satisfied  with  the  taste  and  texture  of  it  . 
16_gourmet_neg_3	 However  , 
16_gourmet_neg_4	 I  can  not  tolerate  gluten  or  rice 
16_gourmet_neg_5	 and  after  eating  some  of  what  I  had  baked  , 
16_gourmet_neg_6	 I  had  an  allergic  reaction  . 
16_gourmet_neg_7	 I  called  the  company  and  they  could  not  tell  me  anything  in  regards  to  their  mills 
16_gourmet_neg_8	 nor  if  there  could  be  any  cross-contamination  . 
16_gourmet_neg_9	 The  lady  on  the  phone  seemed  to  think 
16_gourmet_neg_10	 that  the  mills  are  shared  equipment 
16_gourmet_neg_11	 and  that  no  precautions  are  taken 
16_gourmet_neg_12	 to  avoid  cross-contamination  . 
16_gourmet_neg_13	 If  you  `  re  buying  it  for  low-carb  prep  only  , 
16_gourmet_neg_14	 it  should  be  a  good  flour  at  a  great  deal  . 
16_gourmet_neg_15	 Please  beware  if  you  are  using 
16_gourmet_neg_16	it
16_gourmet_neg_17	 to  avoid  gluten  or  other  allergenic  grains 
9_gourmet_neg_1	 I  have  multiple  concerns  with  this  product  . 
9_gourmet_neg_2	 Out  of  the  box  , 
9_gourmet_neg_3	 they  really  do  look  fresh 
9_gourmet_neg_4	 and  plump  like  they  do  in  the  picture  . 
9_gourmet_neg_5	 However  , 
9_gourmet_neg_6	 you  soon  notice  the  lack  of  instructions  . 
9_gourmet_neg_7	 None  . 
9_gourmet_neg_8	" ""The  only  documentation  at  all  is  a  """"  California  """"  sticker  .  .  ."" "
9_gourmet_neg_9	 with  no  reference  to  a  web  site  . 
9_gourmet_neg_10	 Nada  . 
9_gourmet_neg_11	 My  grapes  broke  quickly  . 
9_gourmet_neg_12	 When  I  received  them 
9_gourmet_neg_13	 they  looked  just  like  the  picture  . 
9_gourmet_neg_14	 But  in  a  couple  days  I  started  noticing 
9_gourmet_neg_15	 they  were  n't  as  plump 
9_gourmet_neg_16	 and  were  shriveling  . 
9_gourmet_neg_17	 Withing  a  week  , 
9_gourmet_neg_18	 many  were  brown 
9_gourmet_neg_19	 and  certainly  lacked  freshness  . 
9_gourmet_neg_20	 It  was  so  bad  , 
9_gourmet_neg_21	 that  I  was  in  shock  , 
9_gourmet_neg_22	 and  I  kept 
9_gourmet_neg_23	 holding  up  the  picture  next  to  them  to  compare 
9_gourmet_neg_24	 because  I  could  n't  believe 
9_gourmet_neg_25	 it  . 
9_gourmet_neg_26	 It  was  like  they  were  deteriorating  right  before  my  eyes  . 
9_gourmet_neg_27	 Within  a  month  they  looked  awful  . 
9_gourmet_neg_28	 They  looked  like  moldy  raisins  . 
9_gourmet_neg_29	 Really  Moldy  . 
9_gourmet_neg_30	 Not  recommended

3_gourmet_pos_30	 they  come  in  a  variety  of  flavors  . 
3_gourmet_pos_31	 The  milk  chocolate  and  cherry  filling  is  like  Claude  Debussy  's  R  verie  . 
3_gourmet_pos_32	 It  is  difficult  to  describe  besides  saying 
3_gourmet_pos_33	 it  is  like  a  delicate  cherry  icing 
3_gourmet_pos_34	 wrapped  in  milk  chocolate  . 
3_gourmet_pos_35	 Merveilleux  -  Milk  or  dark  chocolate

6_gourmet_pos_1	 New  to  Thai  cuisine  , 
6_gourmet_pos_2	 I  asked  to  try  a  milder  curry  , 
6_gourmet_pos_3	 my  tastes 
6_gourmet_pos_4	 running  to  a  maximum  of  medium  heat  . 
6_gourmet_pos_5	 Yellow  curry  was  recommended  ,  and  the  coconut  milk  based  Thai  version  was  a  treat  with  both  seafood  and  chicken-something 
6_gourmet_pos_6	 I  `  ve  had  occasion 
6_gourmet_pos_7	 to  order  again  and  again  . 
6_gourmet_pos_8	So
6_gourmet_pos_9	 when  trying  to  re-create  the  taste  sensations  above  , 
6_gourmet_pos_10	 I  was  less  than  thrilled  at  the  idea  of  grinding  individual  spices  , 
6_gourmet_pos_11	 purchasing  a  number  of  pricey  ingredients  with  limited  shelf  life  and  narrow  applications  . 
6_gourmet_pos_12	 I  did  some  research 
6_gourmet_pos_13	 and  found  that  many  Thai  housewives  rely  on  the  time  and  labor  savings  of  using  high  quality  curry  pastes  as  the  basis  for  soups  ,  curries  and  more  . 
6_gourmet_pos_14	 Mae  Ploy  was  one  of  the  brands  repeatly  mentioned  as  high  quality  and  fresh  tasting  . 
6_gourmet_pos_15	 This  brand  comes  in  a  handful  of  flavors  and  heat  levels  ,  with  the  Yellow  Curry  Paste  being  the  first 
6_gourmet_pos_16	 I  was  eager  to  try  . 
6_gourmet_pos_17	 It  has  a  shelf  life  of  2  years  , 
6_gourmet_pos_18	 and  the  large  plastic  pouch  also  keeps  very  well  nestled  in  its  own  colorful  tub  in  the  refrigerator  . 
6_gourmet_pos_19	 The  flavors  of  lemon  grass  ,  shallot  ,  gingery  galanga  ,  kaffir  lime  peel  ,  warm  spices  and  red  chili  are  very  well  balanced  . 
6_gourmet_pos_20	 This  is  the  only  Mae  Ploy  Curry  paste  without  shrimp  paste  , 
6_gourmet_pos_21	 making  it  vegan-suitable  as  well  as  delicious  with  shellfish  ,  fish  or  fowl  . 
6_gourmet_pos_22	 I  like  to  snip  off  one  corner  of  the  clear  packet  , 
6_gourmet_pos_23	 then  squeeze  out  just  the  amount 
6_gourmet_pos_24	 I  need-anywhere  from  1\/2  teaspoon  to  2  Tablespoons  , 
6_gourmet_pos_25	 depending  on  the  recipe  . 
6_gourmet_pos_26	 This  helps  to  maintain  freshness  and  flavor 
6_gourmet_pos_27	 and  avoid  waste  . 
6_gourmet_pos_28	 For  Thai  curry  , 
6_gourmet_pos_29	 I  will  combine  the  Yellow  Curry  Paste  with  a  small  amount  of  chicken  broth  , 
6_gourmet_pos_30	 then  add  3\/4  Cup  more  broth  per  person  ,  plus  a  can  of  coconut  milk  to  mellow  and  round  the  flavor  . 
6_gourmet_pos_31	 A  cup  or  two  of  chunked  seafood  or  chicken  ,  plus  cubed  potatoes  and  onion-simmered  together  for  about  30  minutes  -  makes  a  very  satisfying  dish  to  serve  with  either  traditional  sticky  rice  or  more  the  more  occidental  long  grain  variety  . 
6_gourmet_pos_32	 Mae  Ploy  's  Thai  Yellow  Curry  is  also  delicious  with  just  a  bit 
6_gourmet_pos_33	 added  to  your  favorite  dip  ,  salad  dressing  ,  or  try  a  teaspoonful 
6_gourmet_pos_34	 combined  with  1  cup  of  sour  cream  or  plain  yogurt  '  painted  '  over  your  favorite  fish  fillets  and  baked  just  until  cooked  through  , 
6_gourmet_pos_35	 -LRB-  about  15-20  minutes  at  325  -RRB-  . 
6_gourmet_pos_36	 The  fine  quality  of  this  product  has  encouraged  me  to  order  another  flavorful  curry  paste-also  excellent-and 
6_gourmet_pos_37	 I  would  highly  recommend  this  product  for  those 
6_gourmet_pos_38	 wishing  to  re-create  favorite  restaurant  fare  at  a  reasonal  price  , 
6_gourmet_pos_39	 without  tedious  preparation 
13_kitchen_neg_1	 We  purchased  this  machine  for  our  small  coffee  shop  2  months  ago  as  in  the  discription 
13_kitchen_neg_2	 it  was  said 
13_kitchen_neg_3	 to  be  for  light  commercial  use  . 
13_kitchen_neg_4	 We  make 
13_kitchen_neg_5	 probably  20-30  cups  of  coffee  a  day  . 
13_kitchen_neg_6	 Our  problems  began  the  first  week  after  receiving  it  . 
13_kitchen_neg_7	 The  machine  makes  great  froth  for  cappuccinoes 
13_kitchen_neg_8	 but  if  you  want  to  have  steamed  milk  instead  of  frothed  it 
13_kitchen_neg_9	 either  comes  out  of  luke  warm  temperature  allthough  the  setting  is  on  high  temperature  or  if  you  put  the  dial  almost  on  the  line  between  latte  and  cappuccino  it  gives  you  too  much  foam  , 
13_kitchen_neg_10	 which  lattes  should  n't  have  . 
13_kitchen_neg_11	 So  customers  complain  about  their  lattes 
13_kitchen_neg_12	 being  either  too  cool  or  too  foamy  . 
13_kitchen_neg_13	 We  called  the  manufacturer  's  customer  service 
13_kitchen_neg_14	 and  were  rudely  brushed  off  . 
13_kitchen_neg_15	 For  a  small  business  like  us  it  is  hard  to  close  for  2-3  weeks  to  send  the  machine  for  temperature  adjustment  service  ,  so  we  had  to  deal  with  it  . 
13_kitchen_neg_16	 Another  problem  came  up  3-4  weeks  later  , 
13_kitchen_neg_17	 when  the  machine  started  shutting  off  by  itself  in  the  middle  of  steaming\/frothing  cycle  or  frother  cleaning  cycle  . 
13_kitchen_neg_18	 Sometimes  we  had  to  restart  it  up  to  5  times  to  make  1  cup  of  hot  chocolate  ,  just  to  steam  milk  . 
13_kitchen_neg_19	 At  the  customer  service  we  were  told  to  reset  the  computer  by  unplugging  the  machine  for  a  couple  of  hours  , 
13_kitchen_neg_20	 which  we  did  . 
13_kitchen_neg_21	 It  did  not  shut  off  for  1  day  ! 
13_kitchen_neg_22	 The  next  day  the  problem  started  again  .  .  . 
13_kitchen_neg_23	 I  perform  every  neccessary  cleaning  or  maintenance  procedure  that  machine  prompts  and  cappuccino  cleaning  daily  ,  so  you  can  not  say 
13_kitchen_neg_24	 that  the  machine  is  being  neglected  . 
13_kitchen_neg_25	 We  are  very  disappointed  with  this  machine  . 
13_kitchen_neg_26	 For  the  price 
13_kitchen_neg_27	 that  you  pay 
13_kitchen_neg_28	 you  would  think 
13_kitchen_neg_29	 that  at  least  customer  service  would  be  polite  ,  understanding  and  helpful  . 
13_kitchen_neg_30	 Now  we  are  looking  for  another  machine  ,  a  back  up  one  , 
13_kitchen_neg_31	 to  be  able  to  send  Impressa  Z5  for  service  .  . 
1_kitchen_neg_1	 Within  a  few  weeks  of  purchase 
1_kitchen_neg_2	 the  teflon  in  the  Zojirushi  pan  started  to  blister  and  flake  off  . 
1_kitchen_neg_3	 This  is  NOT  the  result  of  customer  abuse  but  a  manufacturing  defect  . 
1_kitchen_neg_4	 This  is  my  third  -LRB-  and  final  -RRB- 
1_kitchen_neg_5	 bread  machine  . 
1_kitchen_neg_6	 The  first  two  were  Breadman  Ultimates  . 
1_kitchen_neg_7	 I  should  note  that  I  make  bread  in  the  machine  about  6  times  a  week  on  average  ,  pretty  much  every  morning  . 
1_kitchen_neg_8	 The  first  Breadman  worked  for  over  a  year  until  the  teflon  in  the  pan  started  to  fail  . 
1_kitchen_neg_9	 This  was  probably  my  fault  for  allowing  the  pan 
1_kitchen_neg_10	 to  soak  for  extended  periods  of  time 
1_kitchen_neg_11	 -LRB-  water  can  get  behind  the  teflon 
1_kitchen_neg_12	 and  ruin  the  bond  -RRB-  . 
1_kitchen_neg_13	 I  bought  an  new  Breadman  Ultimate 
1_kitchen_neg_14	 because  the  entire  machine  was  only  slightly  more  than  the  pan  alone  and  the  old  machine  was  starting  to  have  mechanical  problems  . 
1_kitchen_neg_15	 This  time  I  took  extremely  good  care  of  the  pan 
1_kitchen_neg_16	 -LRB-  letting  it  cool  down  ,  no  soaking  -RRB- 
1_kitchen_neg_17	 because  it  's  clearly  the  weak  link  in  the  system  . 
1_kitchen_neg_18	 Within  8  months  the  stirring  shaft  that  drives  the  paddle  in  the  pan  simply  fell  out  . 
1_kitchen_neg_19	 Whatever  the  detente  mechanism  was  that  holds  the  shaft  to  the  pan  failed  , 
1_kitchen_neg_20	 making  the  machine  useless  . 
1_kitchen_neg_21	 Currently  it  does  n't  seem  very  easy 
1_kitchen_neg_22	 -LRB-  or  even  possible  -RRB- 
1_kitchen_neg_23	 to  buy  a  replacement  pan  for  the  Breadman  . 
1_kitchen_neg_24	 At  this  point  I  was  done  with  the  Breadman  . 
1_kitchen_neg_25	 Much  as  I  did  n't  want  to  spring  for  the  extra  money  for  the  Zojirushi  , 
1_kitchen_neg_26	 and  realizing 
1_kitchen_neg_27	 that  my  default  augmented 
1_kitchen_neg_28	 sourdough  recipe  probably  would  n't  work  the  same  in  the  new  machine  , 
1_kitchen_neg_29	 I  did  n't  see  an  alternative 
1_kitchen_neg_30	 and  got  one  . 
1_kitchen_neg_31	 Within  3  weeks  the  teflon  in  the  Zoji  pan  formed  two  blisters  . 
1_kitchen_neg_32	 One  is  bit 
1_kitchen_neg_33	 smaller  than  a  dime  and  all  the  teflon  at  this  spot  has  flaked  off  ; 
1_kitchen_neg_34	 the  other  spot  is  blistering 
1_kitchen_neg_35	 but  the  teflon  is  still  intact  . 
1_kitchen_neg_36	 I  have  been  extremely  careful  with  the  pan  : 
1_kitchen_neg_37	 I  wait 
1_kitchen_neg_38	 for  it  to  cool  and  then  remove  the  baked-on  bread  under  the  paddles  with  warm  water  using  mostly  my  fingers  . 
1_kitchen_neg_39	 I  do  n't  let  it  soak  at  all  . 
1_kitchen_neg_40	 This  is  clearly  a  manufacturing  defect  . 
1_kitchen_neg_41	 I  have  further  complaints  with  respect  to  this  machine  as  compared  to  the  Breadman  Ultimate  : 
1_kitchen_neg_42	 1  -RRB-  The  top  of  the  bread  rarely  gets  brown  . 
1_kitchen_neg_43	 I  `  ve  added  more  sugar  to  the  recipe 
1_kitchen_neg_44	 which  helps  slightly 
1_kitchen_neg_45	 but  not  much  . 
1_kitchen_neg_46	 2  -RRB-  I  do  n't  understand  what  the  crust  control  option  does  . 
1_kitchen_neg_47	 It  does  n't  seem  to  increase  baking  time 
1_kitchen_neg_48	 which  it  does  on  the  Breadman  so  it  does  n't  make  much  sense  . 
1_kitchen_neg_49	 3  -RRB-  The  programmability  is  very  weak  . 
1_kitchen_neg_50	 On  the  Breadman 
1_kitchen_neg_51	 you  can  take  any  of  the  existing  standard  options 
1_kitchen_neg_52	 and  modify  them  as  well  as  make  up  entirely  new  programs  . 
1_kitchen_neg_53	 4  -RRB-  The  programmability  options  are  very  limited  : 
1_kitchen_neg_54	 -  You  ca  n't  control  the  knockdown  time  between  risings  . 
1_kitchen_neg_55	 -  You  ca  n't  add  risings  to  the  default  three  . 
1_kitchen_neg_56	 They  do  give  you  a  lot  of  time  control  on  the  risings  . 
1_kitchen_neg_57	 -  You  ca  n't  separate  the  mixing  cycle  from  the  kneading  cycle  : 
1_kitchen_neg_58	 it  's  all  one  cycle  . 
1_kitchen_neg_59	-
1_kitchen_neg_60	 When  you  turn  off  the  preheat  cycle  , 
1_kitchen_neg_61	 this  only  affects  the  built-in  programs  and  not  the  custom  ones  . 
1_kitchen_neg_62	 -  And  worst  of  all  : 
1_kitchen_neg_63	you
1_kitchen_neg_64	 ca  n't  bake  for  more  than  70  minutes  . 
1_kitchen_neg_65	 This  is  utterly  ridiculous  . 
1_kitchen_neg_66	" ""I  'm  sure  this  is  a  """"  safety  feature  """""" "
1_kitchen_neg_67	 but  it  means 
1_kitchen_neg_68	 you  ca  n't  correct  for  the  pathetic  lack  of  crust  formation  or  have  larger  recipes 
1_kitchen_neg_69	 and  so  forth  . 
1_kitchen_neg_70	 This  is  almost  a  killer  limitation  in  my  opinion  . 
1_kitchen_neg_71	 For  those  other  reviewers 
1_kitchen_neg_72	 that  are  having  issues  with  rising  , 
1_kitchen_neg_73	 I  `  ve  determined 
1_kitchen_neg_74	 that  the  machine  is  very  sensitive  to  the  amount  ,  type  ,  and  quality  of  yeast  . 
1_kitchen_neg_75	 If  you  \*  exactly  \*  follow  the  manufacturers  instuctions  with  respect 
1_kitchen_neg_76	 to  yeast  and  use  fresh  yeast  , 
1_kitchen_neg_77	 it  should  work  okay  . 
1_kitchen_neg_78	 This  means  you  must  use  rapid  rise  yeast  with  the  Quick  programs 
1_kitchen_neg_79	 and  active  dry  yeast  with  the  longer  standard  programs  . 
1_kitchen_neg_80	 Even  using  Fleischmann  's  instead  of  Red  Star  made  a  difference  . 
1_kitchen_neg_81	 The  Breadman  was  pretty  much  indifferent  to  yeast  variations  . 
1_kitchen_neg_82	 At  this  point  I  'm 
1_kitchen_neg_83	 done  with  bread  machines  . 
1_kitchen_neg_84	 They  are  a  failed  technology  . 
1_kitchen_neg_85	 In  fact  ,  teflon  is  a  dangerous  and  substandard  technology  . 
1_kitchen_neg_86	 All  you  have  to  do  is  search  for  teflon 
1_kitchen_neg_87	 -LRB-  Polytetrafluoroethylene  -RRB- 
1_kitchen_neg_88	 and  toxic  to  come  up  with  some  pretty  alarming  data  on  this  noxious  substance  . 
1_kitchen_neg_89	 The  manufacturing  process  results  in  significant  environmental  contamination  . 
1_kitchen_neg_90	 A  direct  consumer  health  risk  due  to  toxic  outgassing  occurs 
1_kitchen_neg_91	 when  teflon  is  exposed  to  temperatures  above  500  degrees 
1_kitchen_neg_92	 -LRB-  eg  : 
1_kitchen_neg_93	 frying  pans  -RRB-  . 
1_kitchen_neg_94	 Perhaps  bread  machines  are  not  that  risky 
1_kitchen_neg_95	 given  the  lower  temps 
1_kitchen_neg_96	 involved  in  baking  and  the  fact 
1_kitchen_neg_97	 that  wet  dough  will  keep  the  average  pan  temperature  pretty  low  ,  but  if  you  know  anything  about  toxicity 
1_kitchen_neg_98	 you  will  realize  that  it  is  always  a  sliding  scale  : 
1_kitchen_neg_99	 there  will  be  some  outgassing  at  lower  temperatures  . 
1_kitchen_neg_100	 Imagine  low  levels  of  toxic  gas 
1_kitchen_neg_101	 released  into  your  homemade  bread  . 
1_kitchen_neg_102	 I  `  ve  thought  about  this  , 
1_kitchen_neg_103	 but  there  's  no  way  to  make  a  bread  machine  without  teflon  -- 
1_kitchen_neg_104	 going  from  mixing  dough  to  baking  requires  teflon  , 
1_kitchen_neg_105	 there  is  just  no  other  viable  solution  . 
1_kitchen_neg_106	 I  love 
1_kitchen_neg_107	 making  bread  every  day 
1_kitchen_neg_108	 and  I  'm  going  to  miss  this  activity 
1_kitchen_neg_109	 but  at  this  point  the  manufacturing  defects  and  use  of  teflon  mean 
1_kitchen_neg_110	 I  have  to  give  up  on  this  technology  . 
1_kitchen_neg_111	 It  's  back  to  the  occasional  hand-made  loaf  -- 
1_kitchen_neg_112	 it  's  the  only  rational  and  healthy  solution 
3_kitchen_pos_1	 I  `  ve  lusted  after  a  Super  Auto  for  years  . 
3_kitchen_pos_2	 When  I  finally  decided  to  get  one  , 
3_kitchen_pos_3	 I  did  a  fare  amount  of  investigating  . 
3_kitchen_pos_4	 The  Gaggia  Titanium  had  the  best  spec  's  for  the  price  and  good  reviews  . 
3_kitchen_pos_5	 I  decided  to  spend  the  extra  money  for  the  Stainless  unit  . 
3_kitchen_pos_6	 I  have  n't  seen  the  painted  plastic  model 
3_kitchen_pos_7	 so  I  ca  n't  comment  on  the  appearance  . 
3_kitchen_pos_8	 I  do  think 
3_kitchen_pos_9	 the  Stainless  looks  great  ! 
3_kitchen_pos_10	 You  can  find  reviews  of  the  non-stainless  here  on  Amazon  and  other  than  the  outside  appearance  ,  the  device  is  the  same  . 
3_kitchen_pos_11	 I  `  ve  only  had  the  unit  for  a  few  days 
3_kitchen_pos_12	 but  so  far  , 
3_kitchen_pos_13	 I  'm  very  happy  . 
3_kitchen_pos_14	 To  the  negatives  first  . 
3_kitchen_pos_15	 The  manual  is  awful  ! 
3_kitchen_pos_16	 It  's  not  just  the  Italian  to  English  translation  ! 
3_kitchen_pos_17	 The  text  is  skimpy  and  the  illustrations  not  so  great  . 
3_kitchen_pos_18	 I  spent 
3_kitchen_pos_19	 a  fair  amount  of  time  making  sure 
3_kitchen_pos_20	 I  understood 
3_kitchen_pos_21	 how  to  setup  and  use  the  unit  . 
3_kitchen_pos_22	 I  'm  pretty  technically  savvy  and  in  the  end  , 
3_kitchen_pos_23	 I  figured  it  all  out  . 
3_kitchen_pos_24	 But  do  n't  rush  into  using  this  product 
3_kitchen_pos_25	 until  you  `  ve  figured  out 
3_kitchen_pos_26	 how  to  set  it  up  ,  clean  it 
3_kitchen_pos_27	 and  adjust  all  the  settings 
3_kitchen_pos_28	 -LRB-  there  are  many  -RRB-  . 
3_kitchen_pos_29	 The  only  issue  I  `  ve  had  is  whereby  the  auto  bean  grinder  thinks 
3_kitchen_pos_30	 it  's  empty 
3_kitchen_pos_31	 when  it  's  not  . 
3_kitchen_pos_32	 Open  the  lid 
3_kitchen_pos_33	-LRB-
3_kitchen_pos_34	 which  could  be  a  bit  better  designed  -RRB- 
3_kitchen_pos_35	 and  stir  and 
3_kitchen_pos_36	 it  works  . 
3_kitchen_pos_37	 Could  be  the  beans 
3_kitchen_pos_38	 I  'm  using  not  sure  . 
3_kitchen_pos_39	 It  's  an  intermittent  issue  . 
3_kitchen_pos_40	 The  good  stuff  : 
3_kitchen_pos_41	 once  you  figure  out  the  coffee  strength  and  grind  ,  the  Gaggia  makes  a  delicious  cup  . 
3_kitchen_pos_42	 I  wish 
3_kitchen_pos_43	 the  brew  were  a  tad  hotter 
3_kitchen_pos_44	 -LRB-  I  have  it  set  to  max  -RRB- 
3_kitchen_pos_45	 but  using  the  cup  warmer  helps  . 
3_kitchen_pos_46	 No  issues  making  froth  with  the  wand  ; 
3_kitchen_pos_47	 much  better  than  the  older  manual  machine 
3_kitchen_pos_48	 I  had  . 
3_kitchen_pos_49	 You  ca  n't  put  a  huge  mug  under  the  unit 
3_kitchen_pos_50	 -LRB-  the  max  size  is  4.5  inches  -RRB- 
3_kitchen_pos_51	 but  its  so  easy  to  make  a  cup  you  just  make  fresh 
3_kitchen_pos_52	 when  needed  . 
3_kitchen_pos_53	 You  can  set  the  unit  for  the  amount  of  brew  . 
3_kitchen_pos_54	 However  , 
3_kitchen_pos_55	" ""I  found  that  clicking  the  """"  large  coffee  """"  button  twice  ,  the  unit  thinks"" "
3_kitchen_pos_56	 it  's  making  2  cups 
3_kitchen_pos_57	 and  that  just  about  fills  a  decent  size  mug  . 
3_kitchen_pos_58	 It  's  much  stronger  too  since  the  unit  grinds  two  doses  of  coffee  instead  of  just  adding  more  hot  water 
3_kitchen_pos_59	 using  the  programmable  size  . 
3_kitchen_pos_60	 You  get  a  nice  foam  on  top 
3_kitchen_pos_61	 and  as  I  said  , 
3_kitchen_pos_62	 the  coffee  is  outstanding  . 
3_kitchen_pos_63	 I  love  the  clean  up 
3_kitchen_pos_64	 -LRB-  or  lack  of  -RRB- 
3_kitchen_pos_65	 compared  to  the  drip  maker  I  had  -LRB-  a  Bodum  Vacuum  unit  -RRB-  . 
3_kitchen_pos_66	 I  still  have  that  unit 
3_kitchen_pos_67	 should  I  need  to  make  a  lot  of  coffee  for  company  . 
3_kitchen_pos_68	 But  for  the  two  mugs 
3_kitchen_pos_69	 I  drink  in  the  morning  , 
3_kitchen_pos_70	 the  Gaggia  easily  replaces  this  unit  . 
3_kitchen_pos_71	 And  there  's  far  less  cleanup  . 
3_kitchen_pos_72	 The  grinds  sit  in  a  canister 
3_kitchen_pos_73	 and  after  a  few  days  , 
3_kitchen_pos_74	 you  just  tap  it  out  into  the  trash 
3_kitchen_pos_75	 and  maybe  rinse  . 
3_kitchen_pos_76	 So  , 
3_kitchen_pos_77	 you  can  use  this  Gaggia  to  replace  a  conventional  coffee  machine  as  long  as  you  `  re  making  a  cup  or  two  . 
3_kitchen_pos_78	 What  I  love  is  just  pressing  a  button  twice 
3_kitchen_pos_79	 -LRB-  for  two  large  coffees  -RRB- 
3_kitchen_pos_80	 and  walking  away  from  the  unit  . 
3_kitchen_pos_81	 A  minute  later  ,  a  great  cup  of  Joe  . 
3_kitchen_pos_82	 It  truly  is  super  automatic  . 
3_kitchen_pos_83	 I  have  the  unit 
3_kitchen_pos_84	 set  for  Energy  savor 
3_kitchen_pos_85	 whereby  it  's  in  a  kind  of  sleep  mode  a  few  hours  after  I  use  it  . 
3_kitchen_pos_86	 I  only  drink  in  the  morning  . 
3_kitchen_pos_87	 However  , 
3_kitchen_pos_88	" ""if  you  decide  to  """"  wake  it  up  """"  ,"" "
3_kitchen_pos_89	 it  heats  up  in  about  2  minutes  . 
3_kitchen_pos_90	 It  also  does  a  rinse  cycle 
3_kitchen_pos_91	 so  I  keep  a  small  glass  under  the  unit  so  it  can  clean  itself 
3_kitchen_pos_92	 and  rinse  out  about  3oz  of  water  . 
3_kitchen_pos_93	 There  is  a  little  pan 
3_kitchen_pos_94	 under  which  would  catch  the  water 
3_kitchen_pos_95	 but  then  you  have  to  toss  it  out  ever  few  days  . 
3_kitchen_pos_96	" ""There  's  also  a  """"  full  Rinse  """"  cycle"" "
3_kitchen_pos_97	 that  thoroughly  cleans  out  the  unit 
3_kitchen_pos_98	 and  uses  about  half  the  water  in  the  reservoir  . 
3_kitchen_pos_99	 It  's  a  menu  item 
3_kitchen_pos_100	 so  do  n't  select  it 
3_kitchen_pos_101	 unless  you  really  want  to  do  this 
3_kitchen_pos_102	 -LRB-  takes  about  5  minutes  and  a  lot  of  water  goes  into  the  catch  pan  or  several  cups  if  you  so  desire  -RRB-  . 
3_kitchen_pos_103	 Yes  it  cost  big  bucks 
3_kitchen_pos_104	 but  as  long  as  it  works  well  for  years 
3_kitchen_pos_105	 and  keeps  its  great  looks  , 
3_kitchen_pos_106	 I  'm  very  happy  . 
3_kitchen_pos_107	 UPDATE  . 
3_kitchen_pos_108	 The  issue  with  the  grinder  was  the  beans 
3_kitchen_pos_109	 -LRB-  too  oily  -RRB-  . 
3_kitchen_pos_110	 I  called  the  NY  office 
3_kitchen_pos_111	" ""and  got  someone  in  """"  tech  support  """""" "
3_kitchen_pos_112	 in  minutes  . 
3_kitchen_pos_113	 She  knew 
3_kitchen_pos_114	 her  product  . 
3_kitchen_pos_115	 Sure  enough  ,  the  inside  of  the  grinder  area  was  super  oily 
3_kitchen_pos_116	 making  it  hard  for  the  beans 
3_kitchen_pos_117	 to  fall  into  the  grinder  area  . 
5_kitchen_pos_1	 Le  Creuset  manufactures  porcelain  enameled  cast  iron  cooking  vessels  as  well  as  other  quality  products  . 
5_kitchen_pos_2	 The  enameled  cookware  is  cast  from  molten  iron 
5_kitchen_pos_3	 formed  in  sand  moulds 
5_kitchen_pos_4	 which  are  used  only  once  . 
5_kitchen_pos_5	 For  this  reason  ,  one  pan  may  look  like  another  , 
5_kitchen_pos_6	 but  each  is  unique  in  its  own  way  . 
5_kitchen_pos_7	 Cast  iron  is  a  highly  efficient  material 
5_kitchen_pos_8	 which  absorbs  and  distributes  heat  efficiently  . 
5_kitchen_pos_9	 For  this  reason  , 
5_kitchen_pos_10	 it  is  recommended  to  use  on  low  to  medium  heat  . 
5_kitchen_pos_11	 There  are  a  few  exceptions  like  boiling  water 
5_kitchen_pos_12	 where  cooking  on  high  heat  is  appropriate  and  okay  . 
5_kitchen_pos_13	 Otherwise  ,  cooking  with  high  heat  may  cause  food 
5_kitchen_pos_14	 to  stick  ,  discolor  the  enamel  coating  ,  or  cook  the  food  unevenly  . 
5_kitchen_pos_15	 Remove  cast  iron  from  the  heat 
5_kitchen_pos_16	 and  it  does  not  cool  off  quickly  . 
5_kitchen_pos_17	 This  helps  your  food  stay  warm  while  serving  . 
5_kitchen_pos_18	 Beware  ; 
5_kitchen_pos_19	 iron  tends  to  be  heavy 
5_kitchen_pos_20	 so  these  cooking  vessels  tend  to  be  heavy  as  well  . 
5_kitchen_pos_21	 Cast  iron  is  an  effective  material  for  cooking  so  why  cover  it  with  enamel  ? 
5_kitchen_pos_22	 Iron  tends  to  rust  ; 
5_kitchen_pos_23	 iron  oxide 
5_kitchen_pos_24	 -LRB-  rust  -RRB- 
5_kitchen_pos_25	 does  n't  add  any  complimentary  flavors  to  your  food  . 
5_kitchen_pos_26	 If  your  cast  iron  cooking  vessel  was  not  enameled  , 
5_kitchen_pos_27	 you  would  have  to  season 
5_kitchen_pos_28	 and  maintain  it  . 
5_kitchen_pos_29	 Adding  the  porcelain  enamel  not  only  looks  good  , 
5_kitchen_pos_30	 but  has  multiple  benefits  . 
5_kitchen_pos_31	 The  enamel  , 
5_kitchen_pos_32	 being  a  solid  coating  ,  is  one  of  the  most  hygienic  surfaces  to  cook  on  , 
5_kitchen_pos_33	 does  not  stain  ,  absorb  odors  ,  retain  flavors  , 
5_kitchen_pos_34	 and  is  easy  to  clean  . 
5_kitchen_pos_35	 The  enamel  can  be  damaged  ,  so  limit  cooking  tools  to  plastic  or  wood  . 
5_kitchen_pos_36	 The  benefits  of  cooking  with  Le  Creuset  cast  iron  are  many  , 
5_kitchen_pos_37	 but  lets  get  down  to  the  roasting  pan  specifically  . 
5_kitchen_pos_38	 This  pan  holds  5  1\/4  quarts  of  food  ,  measures  9  3\/4  x  14  x  3  inches  internally  ,  and  weighs  10.2  pounds  . 
5_kitchen_pos_39	 5  1\/4  quarts  will  typically  feed  8  -  10  people 
5_kitchen_pos_40	 when  it  comes  to  casseroles  ,  so  consider  your  recipes 
5_kitchen_pos_41	 when  determining  the  size 
5_kitchen_pos_42	 you  need  . 
5_kitchen_pos_43	 Except  for  roasts  ,  the  roasting  pan  tends  to  do  best  if  at  least  3\/4  full  . 
5_kitchen_pos_44	 Any  less 
5_kitchen_pos_45	 and  you  may  overwhelm  your  food  with  heat  evenly  dispersed  in  the  pot  . 
5_kitchen_pos_46	 I  find  that  the  cast  iron  adds  a  crispy  texture  to  food 
5_kitchen_pos_47	 that  may  be  desirable  with  a  dish  like  mac-n-cheese  , 
5_kitchen_pos_48	 while  not  so  desirable  for  other  dishes  . 
5_kitchen_pos_49	 Add  the  Le  Creuset  9  x  11  1\/2  inch  roasting  rack  for  roasting  chickens  and  pork  loins 
5_kitchen_pos_50	 keeping  them  out  of  the  grease  . 
5_kitchen_pos_51	 Some  other  possibilities  for  this  pan  include  casseroles  ,  pork  chops 
5_kitchen_pos_52	 covered  with  cornbread  dressing  ,  dinner  rolls  ,  baked  squash  ,  lasagna  ,  scalloped  potatoes  ,  cobblers  ,  pineapple  upside  down  cake  ,  or  bread  pudding  . 
5_kitchen_pos_53	 The  possibilities  almost  seem  endless  to  your  imagination  . 
5_kitchen_pos_54	 One  feature  that  people  tend  to  complain  about  is  the  cost  . 
5_kitchen_pos_55	 The  cost  does  seem  steep 
5_kitchen_pos_56	 compared  to  other  pans 
5_kitchen_pos_57	 made  from  other  materials  . 
5_kitchen_pos_58	 Heck  ,  cast  iron  does  n't  seem  like  it  should  be  expensive 
5_kitchen_pos_59	 when  comparing  to  that  old  cast  iron  pan  past  generations  have  used  for  cornbread  and  camping  . 
5_kitchen_pos_60	 However  the  manufacturing  process  requires  making  a  mould  for  each  and  every  pan  produced  . 
5_kitchen_pos_61	 They  then  go  through  the  enameling  process 
5_kitchen_pos_62	 before  shipping  these  heavy  pans  . 
5_kitchen_pos_63	 If  you  take  what  goes  into  making  and  distributing  these  high  quality  cast  iron  products  , 
5_kitchen_pos_64	 the  cost  tends  to  make  sense  . 
5_kitchen_pos_65	 Then  consider  that  this  pan  will  easily  last  a  lifetime 
5_kitchen_pos_66	 when  taken  care  of  . 
5_kitchen_pos_67	 PROS  : 
5_kitchen_pos_68	 Extremely  versatile 
5_kitchen_pos_69	 Efficient  absorption  and  distribution  of  heat 
5_kitchen_pos_70	 Hygienic  enamel  cooking  surface 
5_kitchen_pos_71	 Does  not  stain  ,  absorb  odors  ,  or  retain  flavors 
5_kitchen_pos_72	 Easy  to  clean 
5_kitchen_pos_73	 when  not  abused  or  misused 
5_kitchen_pos_74	 Can  be  transferred  from  stove  top  to  the  oven  to  the  table 
5_kitchen_pos_75	 Can  easily  last  a  lifetime 
5_kitchen_pos_76	 CONS  : 
5_kitchen_pos_77	 Its  heavy  ,  as  cast  iron  tends  to  be  weighing  in  at  about  10.2  pounds
