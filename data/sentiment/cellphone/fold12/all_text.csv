12_cell_pos_1	I just purchased this phone four days ago
12_cell_pos_2	and have been impressed with it for the most part .
12_cell_pos_3	The first thing you ` ll notice is how crisp and clear the screen is .
12_cell_pos_4	This is a slider phone ,
12_cell_pos_5	and thankfully you can do most things without sliding the screen
12_cell_pos_6	to expose the number keys .
12_cell_pos_7	The only things that I can think of thus far
12_cell_pos_8	that requires you to expose the keys is to dial a new number
12_cell_pos_9	that 's not in your contacts and to text message .
12_cell_pos_10	Next ,
12_cell_pos_11	we go to the features .
12_cell_pos_12	So we got a 1.3 MP camera , camcorder , music player , 1GB microSD card , bluetooth support , and infrared port . .
12_cell_pos_13	and \* drumroll please \* an FM radio .
12_cell_pos_14	Now , the FM radio is n't satellite
12_cell_pos_15	based , so you can not pick up radio stations from across the U. S . ,
12_cell_pos_16	just those stations local to you .
12_cell_pos_17	Now I will go into the good and bad things about each feature :
12_cell_pos_18	1 . Camera - Impressive picture quality .
12_cell_pos_19	Yes it 's only 1.3 MP compared to those 8MP digital cameras ,
12_cell_pos_20	but can you show me a camera
12_cell_pos_21	that does what this phone does ?
12_cell_pos_22	5\/5
12_cell_pos_23	2 . Camcorder - Not all that impressive .
12_cell_pos_24	While you are recording ,
12_cell_pos_25	the quality seems perfect .
12_cell_pos_26	However ,
12_cell_pos_27	once you play it ,
12_cell_pos_28	it turns a bit distorted .
12_cell_pos_29	Plus ,
12_cell_pos_30	it only allows for 20 seconds of recording time regardless of the size of your microSD card .
12_cell_pos_31	3\/5
12_cell_pos_32	3 . Music Player - Impressive .
12_cell_pos_33	The speaker is of good quality , and very loud .
12_cell_pos_34	However ,
12_cell_pos_35	I still could not find a way to change the order of the songs without making a playlist .
12_cell_pos_36	There 's play , pause , next song , previous song , fast forward , and rewind features
12_cell_pos_37	as buttons as shown in the pictures .
12_cell_pos_38	The buttons must be pressed fairly hard ,
12_cell_pos_39	so your music wo n't start playing spontaneously in your pocket .
12_cell_pos_40	Also , I was blown away on how the quality of the music improves
12_cell_pos_41	once you put on those stock earbuds .
12_cell_pos_42	4\/5
12_cell_pos_43	4 . FM Radio - I bet those
12_cell_pos_44	that have this phone tried to use the radio
12_cell_pos_45	but stopped short
12_cell_pos_46	and told you
12_cell_pos_47	to buy an enhancement .
12_cell_pos_48	Well , the truth is you do n't need to buy anything extra .
12_cell_pos_49	Just plug in the earbuds
12_cell_pos_50	that came with the phone ,
12_cell_pos_51	and this will serve as an ' antenna '
12_cell_pos_52	and will allow you to hear stations .
12_cell_pos_53	And since you need the earbuds to hear the radio ,
12_cell_pos_54	yes the sound will go to the earbuds .
12_cell_pos_55	However ,
12_cell_pos_56	there 's a ' loudspeaker ' option
12_cell_pos_57	that allows the radio to be played through the external speaker ,
12_cell_pos_58	but you still need to keep the earbuds plugged in ,
12_cell_pos_59	as it serves as the ' antenna ' .
12_cell_pos_60	This means that if you want to hear the radio on your phone ,
12_cell_pos_61	you NEED to have the earbuds with you .
12_cell_pos_62	You may need to play around with the position of the phone and antenna
12_cell_pos_63	-LRB- or you may have to move -RRB-
12_cell_pos_64	in order to get clear reception .
12_cell_pos_65	3\/5
12_cell_pos_66	Misc . Info :
12_cell_pos_67	Only two games to included , and both trials .
12_cell_pos_68	-LRB- Lumines , Texas Hold 'em -RRB-
12_cell_pos_69	You ca n't transfer games from another phone .
12_cell_pos_70	You must pay and download them again .
12_cell_pos_71	You ca n't delete the pre-created profiles
12_cell_pos_72	-LRB- those
12_cell_pos_73	that
12_cell_pos_74	come with the phone -RRB- .
12_cell_pos_75	You can just create your own .
12_cell_pos_76	In order to change the phone
12_cell_pos_77	to vibrate ,
12_cell_pos_78	you
12_cell_pos_79	must make a vibrating profile .
12_cell_pos_80	Then to use it ,
12_cell_pos_81	it takes several steps ,
12_cell_pos_82	which is not hard ,
12_cell_pos_83	but inconvenient .
12_cell_pos_84	The interface shows the month and date ,
12_cell_pos_85	but not the day of the week .
12_cell_pos_86	Only two face templates included with the phone .
12_cell_pos_87	That 's all for now .
12_cell_pos_88	Overall :
12_cell_pos_89	4 \/
