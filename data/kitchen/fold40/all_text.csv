20_kitchen_neg_1	I think this may be a great product ,
20_kitchen_neg_2	and is why I bought it .
20_kitchen_neg_3	However , mine NEVER worked
20_kitchen_neg_4	-LRB- and hence was never actually used ,
20_kitchen_neg_5	it was just taken out of the box ! -RRB-
20_kitchen_neg_6	The remote would beep the collar
20_kitchen_neg_7	but not spray .
20_kitchen_neg_8	Seller did have manufacturer send new batteries
20_kitchen_neg_9	-LRB-
20_kitchen_neg_10	which further delayed my
20_kitchen_neg_11	getting a good response to this situation -RRB- .
20_kitchen_neg_12	New batteries arrived , item still did n't spray ,
20_kitchen_neg_13	but seller would only refer me to dealing directly with the manufacturer ,
20_kitchen_neg_14	to get a replacement ,
20_kitchen_neg_15	even though I responded
20_kitchen_neg_16	within their advertised 30 day return policy .
20_kitchen_neg_17	Please read seller information and return policies CAREFULLY !
20_kitchen_neg_18	Even if you get
20_kitchen_neg_19	them to take something back
20_kitchen_neg_20	-LRB-
20_kitchen_neg_21	only if never opened . . .
20_kitchen_neg_22	if opened and does n't work ,
20_kitchen_neg_23	they toss
20_kitchen_neg_24	you
20_kitchen_neg_25	to the manufacturer -RRB- ,
20_kitchen_neg_26	there is a 25 % RESTOCKING FEE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
20_kitchen_neg_27	Pretty exorbitant and not Amazon type service I have come to expect over many years of buying from Amazon !
20_kitchen_neg_28	Be very careful of sellers
20_kitchen_neg_29	that are not Amazon . . . sometimes it is n't very clear it is not Amazon .
20_kitchen_neg_30	My feedback on Seller is on feedback page and seller responded ,
20_kitchen_neg_31	but I do n't get a chance
20_kitchen_neg_32	to respond to their feedback ,
20_kitchen_neg_33	which gives the misconception
20_kitchen_neg_34	that I actually used this product !
20_kitchen_neg_35	I could n't have used it
20_kitchen_neg_36	as it did n't work !
20_kitchen_neg_37	If you want to buy this ,
20_kitchen_neg_38	I 'd recommend a reputable pet store such as Pet Smart
20_kitchen_neg_39	where you can easily take an item back if it does n't work and get a refund .
20_kitchen_neg_40	Even if they are willing to replace something ,
20_kitchen_neg_41	you may not want to risk having future problems with it in a month or two
20_kitchen_neg_42	and would want a refund ,
20_kitchen_neg_43	which most stores have no problem with doing for you .
20_kitchen_neg_44	Next time I go the established pet stores
