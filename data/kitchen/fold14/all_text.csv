14_kitchen_pos_1	This is a lovely little crockpot
14_kitchen_pos_2	whose small size makes it uniquely useful for a number of purposes .
14_kitchen_pos_3	I ` ve owned larger crockpots for a couple decades
14_kitchen_pos_4	-LRB- currently a 6 quart Rival Smartcooker is my mainstay for preparing family-size meals -RRB- ,
14_kitchen_pos_5	but the larger pots take up a significant amount of counter space & are n't at all useful for heating or re-heating small quantities .
14_kitchen_pos_6	This little crockpot , however , is perfect for heating or re-heating 2-4 servings of soup or stew .
14_kitchen_pos_7	I originally bought it , however ,
14_kitchen_pos_8	because it is \* absolutely perfect \* for making hot cereal on cold mornings , especially those hot cereals
14_kitchen_pos_9	that require more than a few minutes of cooking in the microwave or on the stovetop , such as steel-cut oatmeal
14_kitchen_pos_10	-LRB- try the nutty goodness of traditional steel-cut oatmeal
14_kitchen_pos_11	once -LRB- also available here at Amazon -RRB-
14_kitchen_pos_12	"& you ` re unlikely ever to return to instant or "" quick cook "" oatmeal again -RRB- ."
14_kitchen_pos_13	There is nothing nicer on a cold winter morning than walking into the kitchen & knowing that a healthy , delicious hot breakfast is awaiting you .
14_kitchen_pos_14	From mid-October to late-March , virtually every night I prepare my entire family 's hot breakfast cereal for the next morning in this little crockpot , with no more effort
14_kitchen_pos_15	than is required to make single serving of instant oatmeal or cream of wheat in the microwave .
14_kitchen_pos_16	Other uses
14_kitchen_pos_17	we ` ve discovered :
14_kitchen_pos_18	it 's perfect for making & serving hot mulled cider ;
14_kitchen_pos_19	keeping hot dips ,
14_kitchen_pos_20	gravies & warm sauces & syrups
14_kitchen_pos_21	heated on the buffet ;
14_kitchen_pos_22	as a substitute fondue pot ;
14_kitchen_pos_23	& for heating soup at times
14_kitchen_pos_24	when hovering over a stovetop or near a microwave would be incovenient
14_kitchen_pos_25	-LRB- how nice to come inside from raking leaves or shoveling snow to a hot bowl of soup ! -RRB- .
14_kitchen_pos_26	For single people or couples
14_kitchen_pos_27	who prefer not to cook in large quantities or apartment dwellers with limited storage space , this crockpot would be a very acceptable slow cooker ,
14_kitchen_pos_28	especially if used in conjunction with Rival 's inexpensive SP100-PDQ Smart-Part Module
14_kitchen_pos_29	-LRB- also sold on Amazon as of the date of this review -RRB- ,
14_kitchen_pos_30	which provides the same timed-cooking controls
14_kitchen_pos_31	that are integrated with many of Rival 's larger , more expensive crockpots .
14_kitchen_pos_32	The energy used is minimal , too
14_kitchen_pos_33	-- only 80 watts --
14_kitchen_pos_34	& the stoneware bowl fits easily in the dishwasher ,
14_kitchen_pos_35	as does the lid , for very convenient clean-up
