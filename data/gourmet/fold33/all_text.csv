13_gourmet_neg_1	These big internet companies are so good at screwing their companies .
13_gourmet_neg_2	Do you see
13_gourmet_neg_3	how
13_gourmet_neg_4	this scam works ? ? ?
13_gourmet_neg_5	"They sell "" FRESH WHOLE RABBIT """
13_gourmet_neg_6	but when I order it ,
13_gourmet_neg_7	there 's no head or skin !
13_gourmet_neg_8	Can
13_gourmet_neg_9	you believe ? !
13_gourmet_neg_10	Uh ,
13_gourmet_neg_11	excuse me ,
13_gourmet_neg_12	do you think a headless rabbit
13_gourmet_neg_13	"missing its entire skin is "" WHOLE "" ? ? ?"
13_gourmet_neg_14	This is totally misleading .
13_gourmet_neg_15	I have contacted Amazon 3 times asking them to please send me the skin , feet ,
13_gourmet_neg_16	and head so I have the complete set
13_gourmet_neg_17	and they have ignored me or sent me autoresponder emails
13_gourmet_neg_18	that do n't specifically address the missing head and so on .
13_gourmet_neg_19	What they do ,
13_gourmet_neg_20	I 'm guessing , is then resell rabbit heads , rabbit feet , and bloody rabbit scalps on another part of this website ,
13_gourmet_neg_21	and it 's all pure profit .
13_gourmet_neg_22	What a CROCK
