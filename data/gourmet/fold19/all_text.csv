19_gourmet_pos_1	Sing in me oh muse on this snow day ,
19_gourmet_pos_2	and let me proclaim the many virtues of this fine tea .
19_gourmet_pos_3	The scent and flavor of this tea are as close to my conception of ambrosia as anything else that has yet crossed my palate .
19_gourmet_pos_4	It is full without being overbearing ,
19_gourmet_pos_5	it is seasoned without being overpowering .
19_gourmet_pos_6	It 's great with anything from English breakfast fare to hardy curry .
19_gourmet_pos_7	Since conception ,
19_gourmet_pos_8	I have been in love with tea ,
19_gourmet_pos_9	"but "" the Prince "" was my first fine tea ."
19_gourmet_pos_10	I have still not recovered from the episode in which my father-in-law-to-be proved to me that bag tea was a crime against humanity .
19_gourmet_pos_11	And yet despite amorous flirtations with rare white teas
19_gourmet_pos_12	and other wondrous Indian and Chinese estate varieties with unpronounceable names ,
19_gourmet_pos_13	it 's still my favorite .
19_gourmet_pos_14	Never mind the tea purist snobs
19_gourmet_pos_15	who rank on it
19_gourmet_pos_16	because it 's flavored with spice .
19_gourmet_pos_17	Would they send back a fine filet
19_gourmet_pos_18	because the chef elected to use some pepper or shallots ?
19_gourmet_pos_19	Ignore the herbal tea-totalers
19_gourmet_pos_20	who regard caffeine as sinful .
19_gourmet_pos_21	They probably want to outlaw yoga on Sunday too .
19_gourmet_pos_22	Of the five or so Kousmichoff varieties
19_gourmet_pos_23	I ` ve had , this one is the clear winner .
19_gourmet_pos_24	I ` ve gotten my best results using HOT water steeping for five to six minutes .
19_gourmet_pos_25	The stuff is potent enough
19_gourmet_pos_26	that you can get ,
19_gourmet_pos_27	gasp ,
19_gourmet_pos_28	a reasonably tannin-free second infusion .
19_gourmet_pos_29	My only reservation is this ;
19_gourmet_pos_30	once you ` ve entered the universe of fine tea ,
19_gourmet_pos_31	you can never be satisfied
19_gourmet_pos_32	drinking Lipton , Salada , Twinings or Tetley again .
19_gourmet_pos_33	In guise of gifts ,
19_gourmet_pos_34	I have managed to get many of my gastronome friends and relations
19_gourmet_pos_35	addicted so that I may sup of it
19_gourmet_pos_36	when I visit .
19_gourmet_pos_37	Is n't it a delicious irony that perhaps the greatest bourgeoisie decadence of the Romanoff dynasty is today
19_gourmet_pos_38	preserved by our friends in socialist France ?
19_gourmet_pos_39	Viva la Revolution !
