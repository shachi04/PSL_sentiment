20_cell_pos_1	Bought this to replace my three-year-old cell phone and an ancient
20_cell_pos_2	but still working Palm IIIc .
20_cell_pos_3	My observations
20_cell_pos_4	after 30 days of ownership :
20_cell_pos_5	1 . Setup is time consuming but unavoidable .
20_cell_pos_6	Patience is required .
20_cell_pos_7	I ` ve had a couple
20_cell_pos_8	of questions that I asked Cingular , only to be forwarded to Palm , only to be forwarded to Microsoft ,
20_cell_pos_9	then back to Cingular .
20_cell_pos_10	It seems no Customer Service department has really mastered this unit .
20_cell_pos_11	2 . Have to do a soft reset every once in a while .
20_cell_pos_12	The unit turns off the sound by itself and the only way
20_cell_pos_13	I ` ve found to fix
20_cell_pos_14	it is to do a soft reset .
20_cell_pos_15	3 . I 'm not crazy about Microsoft Outlook 's calendar
20_cell_pos_16	compared to Palm 's .
20_cell_pos_17	"I miss several Palm features , like the "" Go to "" and the "" Today "" buttons ."
20_cell_pos_18	Outlook 's calendar just is n't as easy to manuever as Palm 's .
20_cell_pos_19	4 . Phone listening volume is low ,
20_cell_pos_20	especially
20_cell_pos_21	when the unit is in a protective case ,
20_cell_pos_22	which puts it a little further from your ear .
20_cell_pos_23	5 .
20_cell_pos_24	Love the Bluetooth option .
20_cell_pos_25	It 's new to me
20_cell_pos_26	and it 's just great .
20_cell_pos_27	6 .
20_cell_pos_28	Love
20_cell_pos_29	being able to press a picture to make a call .
20_cell_pos_30	We have five kids ;
20_cell_pos_31	I have each kid 's picture
20_cell_pos_32	linked to their phone number .
20_cell_pos_33	Even my technology-challenged husband can call them by simply pressing their picture .
20_cell_pos_34	7 . This phone talks !
20_cell_pos_35	A female voice announces
20_cell_pos_36	who is calling and when your next appointment is .
20_cell_pos_37	The first time she spoke
20_cell_pos_38	it about scared me
20_cell_pos_39	to death .
20_cell_pos_40	The voice reminds me of the computer on Star Trek --
20_cell_pos_41	but not as clear .
20_cell_pos_42	However ,
20_cell_pos_43	after getting used to her accent ,
20_cell_pos_44	she is intelligible ,
20_cell_pos_45	which means the computer is translating my written input into spoken words --
20_cell_pos_46	amazing !
20_cell_pos_47	8 .
20_cell_pos_48	The Internet connection has limited use for me .
20_cell_pos_49	I do n't need email on the run
20_cell_pos_50	and I could live without this and the extra monthly cost .
20_cell_pos_51	Most traditional Internet web sites take much too long to load and display too small a portion of the page to be useful .
20_cell_pos_52	It is nice to check the weather or get directions on the go .
20_cell_pos_53	9 .
20_cell_pos_54	Ca n't imagine watching a movie or any complex video on this tiny screen .
20_cell_pos_55	What 's the point ?
20_cell_pos_56	10 . Splurged on a sweet little Vaja leather case
20_cell_pos_57	that is wonderful .
20_cell_pos_58	Very expensive , but a terrific luxury .
20_cell_pos_59	11 . Amazon 's prices were the best BY FAR on this product !
20_cell_pos_60	Saved over $ 300 off my local retail Cingular dealer .
20_cell_pos_61	12 .
20_cell_pos_62	Best part :
20_cell_pos_63	I no longer have to carry a PDA and a cell phone !
20_cell_pos_64	They are one and the same !
20_cell_pos_65	13 .
20_cell_pos_66	Conclusion :
20_cell_pos_67	this phone is very smart and fun to use ,
20_cell_pos_68	although it comes with a big learning curve .
20_cell_pos_69	The low volume
20_cell_pos_70	issue could be a problem for someone with bad hearing
