4_gourmet_pos_20	WILD SWEET ORANGE :

4_gourmet_pos_22	ZEN :
4_gourmet_pos_23	mild , relaxed green tea
4_gourmet_pos_24	Their ingredients include :
4_gourmet_pos_25	black tea , green tea , hibiscus flowers , chamomile flowers , lemongrass , citric acid , natural flavors , spearmint leaves , blackberry leaves , cinnamon , rooibos , ginger root , rose
4_gourmet_pos_26	hips , orange peel , rose petals , licorice root , safflower , black pepper , lemon verbena leaves , cardamom , cloves , peppermint leaves , chicory , sarsaparilla root , lemon balm leaf , star anise , and red poppy flowers .
4_gourmet_pos_27	Tazo is an interesting company
4_gourmet_pos_28	that makes only super premium teas .
4_gourmet_pos_29	They are socially responsible ,
4_gourmet_pos_30	"based in Portland , and have the motto , "" The Reincarnation of Tea "" ."
4_gourmet_pos_31	Tazo is owned by Starbucks .
4_gourmet_pos_32	Their web site is fun and quirky , with a Zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out .
4_gourmet_pos_33	It is unclear ,
4_gourmet_pos_34	though , from their web site ,
4_gourmet_pos_35	how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher ,
4_gourmet_pos_36	"and they do use some "" natural flavors """
4_gourmet_pos_37	in their teas
4_gourmet_pos_38	--
4_gourmet_pos_39	this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea .
4_gourmet_pos_40	In general
4_gourmet_pos_41	I 'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added ,
4_gourmet_pos_42	preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing .
4_gourmet_pos_43	Overall , the green teas seem good .
4_gourmet_pos_44	The herbal infusions are fine .
4_gourmet_pos_45	The black teas tend to turn bitter if you do n't brew them very briefly . . .
4_gourmet_pos_46	even then they have bitter overtones .
4_gourmet_pos_47	Tazo 's assortment , and Tazo teas in general , are fine -- better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings --
4_gourmet_pos_48	but not anywhere near as good as Numi , or Aspen , or other super premium teas
4_gourmet_pos_49	"made with only "" real "" ingredients and minus all of the flavorings ."
4_gourmet_pos_50	I 'm more used to these high quality teas ,
4_gourmet_pos_51	which Tazo attempts to be ,
4_gourmet_pos_52	but disappoints . . .
4_gourmet_pos_53	so overall Tazo Assorted gets a 3.5 to a 4 .
4_gourmet_pos_54	For this review ,
4_gourmet_pos_55	I 'm rounding up ,
4_gourmet_pos_56	since so many people seem to enjoy these teas ,
4_gourmet_pos_57	and I 'm in the clear minority .
4_gourmet_pos_58	If your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality , no doubt Tazo 's teas will appeal to you ,
4_gourmet_pos_59	as they are a great improvement .
4_gourmet_pos_60	They have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences .
4_gourmet_pos_61	If you do n't enjoy Tazo 's teas , though , know
4_gourmet_pos_62	that there are many , many teas made with all real ingredients , teas
4_gourmet_pos_63	that cost only a fraction more ,
4_gourmet_pos_64	that may be just the thing
4_gourmet_pos_65	you were looking for .
