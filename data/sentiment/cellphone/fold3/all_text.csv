3_cell_pos_1	I bought this phone as part of the Sprint\/Nextel SERO plan .
3_cell_pos_2	I used it for about 14 days before deciding
3_cell_pos_3	that it did n't fit my needs for several reasons
3_cell_pos_4	outlined below :
3_cell_pos_5	- Battery life was sporadic --
3_cell_pos_6	I got maybe a day worth of power from it .
3_cell_pos_7	One time it completely
3_cell_pos_8	discharged overnight .
3_cell_pos_9	For the price of the phone
3_cell_pos_10	-LRB- and the two year contract it carries -RRB-
3_cell_pos_11	this is a dealbreaker .
3_cell_pos_12	- The Nextel network coverage has gone downhill in my area
3_cell_pos_13	-LRB- I was a former Nextel subscriber for 3 years
3_cell_pos_14	-
3_cell_pos_15	so I have some experience with coverage around town -RRB- .
3_cell_pos_16	I was getting disconnects
3_cell_pos_17	and sporadic no signals .
3_cell_pos_18	- The phone would sporadically mute the ringer .
3_cell_pos_19	An incoming call would light up the display
3_cell_pos_20	but there would be no ringing .
3_cell_pos_21	This seems
3_cell_pos_22	to happen
3_cell_pos_23	after I had put the phone on vibrate
3_cell_pos_24	and then turned it back
3_cell_pos_25	to ring .
3_cell_pos_26	- For the same monthly service fee ,
3_cell_pos_27	I was getting less access to web services and no high speed Internet ability .
3_cell_pos_28	Admittedly the high speed access is not as useful on a tiny screen --
3_cell_pos_29	but if I 'm going to be locked into a 2 year contract
3_cell_pos_30	I would like to have some fast internet access on the phone .
3_cell_pos_31	The i880 still uses the slow Nextel data network .
3_cell_pos_32	I was not a Direct Connect\/Walkie Talkie user .
3_cell_pos_33	If I were ,
3_cell_pos_34	then my opinion of this phone might be a little higher
3_cell_pos_35	-LRB- since Nextel presently has arguably the best fully functioning walkie talkie network -RRB- .
3_cell_pos_36	I could not justify being locked into a 2 year contract with equipment
3_cell_pos_37	that seemed sub-par on a network
3_cell_pos_38	that did not
3_cell_pos_39	-LRB- and likely never will -RRB- support the latest high speed technologies .
3_cell_pos_40	Below were my initial impressions during the time I used the phone :
3_cell_pos_41	Thankfully Motorola designed the phone
3_cell_pos_42	so the micro-SD card is accessible from the outside --
3_cell_pos_43	no need to pull the battery
3_cell_pos_44	to update the card .
3_cell_pos_45	Here 's the big things
3_cell_pos_46	I do n't like .
3_cell_pos_47	1 .
3_cell_pos_48	You CAN NOT use any mp3 songs
3_cell_pos_49	that you transfer to the micro-sd card as ringtones .
3_cell_pos_50	2 . You also can not readily load additional wallpapers
3_cell_pos_51	unless it is a picture
3_cell_pos_52	you took with the phone or a paid download .
3_cell_pos_53	Any message
3_cell_pos_54	-LRB- mms -RRB-
3_cell_pos_55	that you send to yourself can only be set as a caller id image and not wallpaper .
3_cell_pos_56	3 . Battery life on my phone is flaky -
3_cell_pos_57	I 'm getting maybe a day and one-half with usage
3_cell_pos_58	that approximates 60 minutes talk time and perhaps 6 to 10 picture messages .
3_cell_pos_59	You must pay Nextel to download ringtones .
3_cell_pos_60	There are some users
3_cell_pos_61	who have modified the phone
3_cell_pos_62	and reportedly are able to use ringtones off their micro-SD memory card - however the process is more technical than what your average user might want to tangle with .
3_cell_pos_63	Note :
3_cell_pos_64	Sprint and Nextel are both owned by the same company .
3_cell_pos_65	If you ` re making a decision on Sprint vs .
3_cell_pos_66	Nextel ,
3_cell_pos_67	there are only a couple reasons
3_cell_pos_68	that I can think of
3_cell_pos_69	to recommend Nextel over Sprint .
3_cell_pos_70	First ,
3_cell_pos_71	if the Nextel coverage is better .
3_cell_pos_72	Second ,
3_cell_pos_73	if you have a need
3_cell_pos_74	to use the Nextel Walkie Talkie feature .
3_cell_pos_75	The Sprint side of the company features phones with significantly enhanced web browsing and higher speed data communications .
3_cell_pos_76	The Nextel side clings to the larger phones
3_cell_pos_77	and aims their services at the industrial\/construction market .
3_cell_pos_78	For almost every consumer , the Sprint side is a better deal .
3_cell_pos_79	Sprint in my experience has better customer service
3_cell_pos_80	whereas Nextel tends to transfer you endlessly among a variety of customer service representatives .
3_cell_pos_81	Here 's my summary of this phone
3_cell_pos_82	after using it about two weeks :
3_cell_pos_83	The Good :
3_cell_pos_84	- beautiful speaker phone
3_cell_pos_85	- compact design \/ solid feel
3_cell_pos_86	-2 megapixel camera , ability to capture movies
3_cell_pos_87	- flip swings open
3_cell_pos_88	when you push a button
3_cell_pos_89	- Nextel sms\/mms messages can now be auto-downloaded -
3_cell_pos_90	I believe
3_cell_pos_91	this is the first Nextel phone to sport this feature
3_cell_pos_92	- nice loud audio
3_cell_pos_93	- both Nextel walkie talkie and DirecTalk support
3_cell_pos_94	The Bad :
3_cell_pos_95	- ca n't play ringtones off Micro SD or via any other non-Nextel transfer
3_cell_pos_96	-LRB- Note :
3_cell_pos_97	Technically some people have been using
3_cell_pos_98	a Motorola product called webjal to make transfers with a cable -
3_cell_pos_99	but this may be more technical
3_cell_pos_100	than the average user would like to tackle -RRB-
3_cell_pos_101	- Nextel is in my opinion on their way out as a carrier , soon to be completely assimilated into the Sprint side of things .
3_cell_pos_102	While not entirely unexpected ,
3_cell_pos_103	it means that Nextel plans and features are not as attractive to non-construction users
3_cell_pos_104	-LRB- Nextel 's core group -RRB- .
3_cell_pos_105	If you want Mobile to Mobile unlimited minutes
3_cell_pos_106	you pay more versus most Sprint plans
3_cell_pos_107	which include them .
3_cell_pos_108	Nextel does n't have the super fast data speeds or network web browsing of competing carriers .
3_cell_pos_109	Most web browsing on Nextel is limited to character
3_cell_pos_110	based wap sites
3_cell_pos_111	that both crawl along speedwise and present unexciting character
3_cell_pos_112	based screens .
3_cell_pos_113	- the phone is a little bigger
3_cell_pos_114	that what some have grown accustomed to .
3_cell_pos_115	-
3_cell_pos_116	while not phone related , some users in larger cities have reported
3_cell_pos_117	the iDen system is nearing capactity with a lot of busy signals .
3_cell_pos_118	- I am only getting about a day of battery life -
3_cell_pos_119	which is extremely low .
