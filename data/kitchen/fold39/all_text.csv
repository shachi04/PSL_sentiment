19_kitchen_neg_1	The vacuum has great suction .
19_kitchen_neg_2	However , suction is the only good quality about this vacuum .
19_kitchen_neg_3	I purchased this vacuum at Sears
19_kitchen_neg_4	and got a good discount during their vacuum sale .
19_kitchen_neg_5	But I have gone through 3 of these vacuums
19_kitchen_neg_6	and have returned or plan on returning each one .
19_kitchen_neg_7	The 1st vacuum got
19_kitchen_neg_8	so much dirt stuck behind and in the hepa filter , the vacuum started making a sound like it was going to break .
19_kitchen_neg_9	The 2nd vacuum had a handle
19_kitchen_neg_10	that was assembled badly so with each forward
19_kitchen_neg_11	and backward pass the handle felt like it was going to come off .
19_kitchen_neg_12	This vacuum is hard to push .
19_kitchen_neg_13	You have to put the carpet
19_kitchen_neg_14	setting at close to high for low carpeting .
19_kitchen_neg_15	On hard surfaces the vacuum is hard to push too !
19_kitchen_neg_16	This vacuum has a large dust cup with 2 sections .
19_kitchen_neg_17	"The small compartment in the back of the dust cup is -LRB- 1 """
19_kitchen_neg_18	"high X 5 """
19_kitchen_neg_19	"wide X 6 """
19_kitchen_neg_20	deep -RRB- for the dirt .
19_kitchen_neg_21	The large front section collects the hair , crumbs and other larger things you pick up off the floor in your home , however dirt and fine particulate dust is what I collect in my vacuum ,
19_kitchen_neg_22	and Hoover only gives you that little compartment for the dirt
19_kitchen_neg_23	so it gets caught in the vacuum behind the hepa filter .
19_kitchen_neg_24	You spend more time cleaning out the vacuum
19_kitchen_neg_25	than you do vacuuming your carpet .
19_kitchen_neg_26	Today I had to pick up the vacuum
19_kitchen_neg_27	and shake it over the trash
19_kitchen_neg_28	can to get most of the dirt out from behind the hepa filter .
19_kitchen_neg_29	Even my husband noticed that this vacuum takes too much time to empty and clean out .
19_kitchen_neg_30	Yes lots of dirt falls onto the vacuum
19_kitchen_neg_31	when you remove the dust cup
19_kitchen_neg_32	and is messy to clean up .
19_kitchen_neg_33	I have tried Kenmore , Eureka , and Fantom in the past .
19_kitchen_neg_34	I plan on returning the 3rd vacuum
19_kitchen_neg_35	once I get my Dyson
19_kitchen_neg_36	I purchased from HSN
