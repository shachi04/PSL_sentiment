14_cell_pos_1	I got this phone 2 weeks back although I have seen this with my cousin in Singapore quite sometime back .
14_cell_pos_2	Just right off the box , the phone is quite impressive .
14_cell_pos_3	Many complain about the response time - yes , this phone is slow
14_cell_pos_4	but does n't bother me
14_cell_pos_5	- far better than my windows machine Overall , very good phone
14_cell_pos_6	for what it offers .
14_cell_pos_7	Pros :
14_cell_pos_8	\* This phone tops in ergonomics , ease of use , presentation , features , Bluetooth , speakerphone and call quality .
14_cell_pos_9	\* Wi-fi is worth
14_cell_pos_10	mentioning separately .
14_cell_pos_11	It is simply superb .
14_cell_pos_12	\* Nokia 's connection manager is far superior than anyone else in the market .
14_cell_pos_13	It handles very
14_cell_pos_14	efficiently that one can easily choose between several access points
14_cell_pos_15	and save lots of money .
14_cell_pos_16	I accidentally
14_cell_pos_17	downloaded a big chunk of data
14_cell_pos_18	and going to pay through my nose next month !
14_cell_pos_19	\* All the apps
14_cell_pos_20	that
14_cell_pos_21	come with this phone are quite good .
14_cell_pos_22	\* BT sync with my apple is just fine with iSync .
14_cell_pos_23	Also I transfer music\/themes\/ringtones
14_cell_pos_24	using data cable from my Wintel .
14_cell_pos_25	"The phone automatically toggles to "" Mass storage "" mode"
14_cell_pos_26	when it is connected to PC ,
14_cell_pos_27	which is pretty neat .
14_cell_pos_28	\* I have n't faced any such problem as I charge my gadgets daily .
14_cell_pos_29	I also tried leaving it uncharged
14_cell_pos_30	and it comes for 2-3 days , good enough for my call volumes .
14_cell_pos_31	\* Symbian browser is fast and stunning .
14_cell_pos_32	Bookmarks feature is neat .
14_cell_pos_33	Having the wi-fi feature helps you to set all the bookmarks
14_cell_pos_34	while you ` re at home
14_cell_pos_35	and then use it wisely
14_cell_pos_36	while you are away .
14_cell_pos_37	\* Camera quality is good .
14_cell_pos_38	Dual camera is just a great idea .
14_cell_pos_39	Camera settings are similar to professional cameras - very very impressive !
14_cell_pos_40	\* Tried the video mode
14_cell_pos_41	and came fine .
14_cell_pos_42	\* Battery life ,
14_cell_pos_43	as many claim ,
14_cell_pos_44	seems short -
14_cell_pos_45	but I charge my gadgets daily - so not a big issue
14_cell_pos_46	\* The headset that comes with the phone is really good .
14_cell_pos_47	\* Tonnes of themes ,
14_cell_pos_48	apps etc available for this phone . . .
14_cell_pos_49	Cons
14_cell_pos_50	\* My first biggest problem is that the main navigation key is badly designed .
14_cell_pos_51	It is made of cheap plastic and almost 8 out of 10 times
14_cell_pos_52	"I "" selected """
14_cell_pos_53	an option
14_cell_pos_54	when I was actually trying to navigate to left .
14_cell_pos_55	It is SO frustrating .
14_cell_pos_56	\* My second biggest problem with this phone is
14_cell_pos_57	when the slider is on ,
14_cell_pos_58	the screen light does not come up .
14_cell_pos_59	So you wo n't know - even in the day -
14_cell_pos_60	"which button to press to answer the question "" Unlock phone ? """
14_cell_pos_61	-
14_cell_pos_62	you will get that
14_cell_pos_63	by practice
14_cell_pos_64	but it is truly a pain .
14_cell_pos_65	\* The process of taking a picture sucks .
14_cell_pos_66	The picture what you see on the screen
14_cell_pos_67	when you hear the shutter sound is NOT what you get .
14_cell_pos_68	There is a serious lag between the shutter click and the final image .
14_cell_pos_69	I sincerely hope if there would be some s\/w patch for this .
14_cell_pos_70	I am anyway not a big fan of phone cameras - with an exception of Sony Ericsson W810i .
14_cell_pos_71	That is one far superior camera quality
14_cell_pos_72	I saw so far .
14_cell_pos_73	\* Slider lock and unlock feature is good and bad .
14_cell_pos_74	I am
14_cell_pos_75	putting this on the bad section as even if the slider opens in your pocket ,
14_cell_pos_76	the phone could turn on
14_cell_pos_77	and end up with accidental redialing .
14_cell_pos_78	So you would need a small app
14_cell_pos_79	to do the locking properly .
14_cell_pos_80	Overall - good phone .
14_cell_pos_81	At this point , Nokia has better phones like N95 etc - of course very expensive .
