4_kitchen_pos_1	What an awesome product !
4_kitchen_pos_2	Heavy-duty and sturdy ,
4_kitchen_pos_3	you 'd never know
4_kitchen_pos_4	"it was an "" assemble-at-home "" item ."
4_kitchen_pos_5	It 's a quality piece of furniture .
4_kitchen_pos_6	It 's on wheels ,
4_kitchen_pos_7	which is a good thing
4_kitchen_pos_8	because it is surprisingly heavy .
4_kitchen_pos_9	Let 's start at the top :
4_kitchen_pos_10	The butcher block top .
4_kitchen_pos_11	It 's three inches thick
4_kitchen_pos_12	and ,
4_kitchen_pos_13	as such ,
4_kitchen_pos_14	it is the heaviest part of the entire kitchen cart .
4_kitchen_pos_15	It is made of fine , high-quality Asian hardwoods .
4_kitchen_pos_16	The finish is oiled and the manufacturer recommends seasoning it regularly with mineral oil .
4_kitchen_pos_17	The next is the cart itself .
4_kitchen_pos_18	Immediately under the butcher block top ,
4_kitchen_pos_19	"there is a 2 """
4_kitchen_pos_20	deep drawer .
4_kitchen_pos_21	It 's large and deep enough
4_kitchen_pos_22	to accommodate a standard utensil holder or other items of your choice .
4_kitchen_pos_23	The pull handle on the drawer
4_kitchen_pos_24	is fashioned out of brushed chrome .
4_kitchen_pos_25	Beneath the drawer ,
4_kitchen_pos_26	there is a shelf .
4_kitchen_pos_27	Surrounding the shelf on three sides are brushed chrome rods ,
4_kitchen_pos_28	adding a modern look .
4_kitchen_pos_29	Matching the brushed chrome are three hooks on the right side of the cart , perfect for hanging larger utensils or pot holders .
4_kitchen_pos_30	Below the shelf is a cabinet with two doors .
4_kitchen_pos_31	The pull handles for the doors also have a brushed chrome finish .
4_kitchen_pos_32	The cabinet is large enough
4_kitchen_pos_33	to hold an entire set of dinnerware
4_kitchen_pos_34	-LRB- as in my case
4_kitchen_pos_35	where I have eight place settings
4_kitchen_pos_36	that include dinner and luncheon plates , fruit and soup bowls , and more -RRB- .
4_kitchen_pos_37	Finally , heavy-duty , professional grade caster wheels support the whole thing .
4_kitchen_pos_38	The two in the front are locking .
4_kitchen_pos_39	To prevent stubbed toes , the wheels can easily be rotated and tucked under the unit .
4_kitchen_pos_40	The easy to follow directions for assembly
4_kitchen_pos_41	-LRB-
4_kitchen_pos_42	which are diagrammed and in English -RRB-
4_kitchen_pos_43	call
4_kitchen_pos_44	only for a Philips screwdriver .
4_kitchen_pos_45	A hex wrench is included for the 18 hex bolts .
4_kitchen_pos_46	I used an electric screwdriver for both the Philips screws
4_kitchen_pos_47	-LRB- 14 in all -RRB-
4_kitchen_pos_48	and the hex bolts
4_kitchen_pos_49	-LRB-
4_kitchen_pos_50	after I found
4_kitchen_pos_51	the right sized hex tip for my screwdriver -RRB- .
4_kitchen_pos_52	I can happily report
4_kitchen_pos_53	that all pieces fit together easily
4_kitchen_pos_54	-LRB- no struggling to match up this piece with that piece -RRB-
4_kitchen_pos_55	and all holes are pre-drilled .
4_kitchen_pos_56	The drawer requires assembly also .
4_kitchen_pos_57	The runners for the drawer are already attached !
4_kitchen_pos_58	You must put together the front , sides and back of the drawer with screws
4_kitchen_pos_59	-LRB- again , all holes are pre-drilled -RRB- .
4_kitchen_pos_60	A word of advice
4_kitchen_pos_61	regarding
4_kitchen_pos_62	assembling the drawer :
4_kitchen_pos_63	Follow the directions
4_kitchen_pos_64	where it says
4_kitchen_pos_65	to put the screws in only halfway
4_kitchen_pos_66	before trying to attach the bottom of the drawer .
4_kitchen_pos_67	I made the mistake of tightening the screws too much and had trouble
4_kitchen_pos_68	sliding the bottom into the assembled front , back and sides .
4_kitchen_pos_69	It 's a snug fit .
4_kitchen_pos_70	Once I loosened the screws enough , the bottom easily popped into place
4_kitchen_pos_71	and I was able to sock it in securely by tightening the screws .
4_kitchen_pos_72	I have only one other thing
4_kitchen_pos_73	to mention regarding the assembly of the entire cart :
4_kitchen_pos_74	Once the body of the cart is assembled and the unit is standing upright ,
4_kitchen_pos_75	you
4_kitchen_pos_76	must lift the butcher block
4_kitchen_pos_77	and set it down on the top of the cart .
4_kitchen_pos_78	At this point ,
4_kitchen_pos_79	you have already placed four cam lock screws on the top of the cart
4_kitchen_pos_80	and they ` re pointing upward .
4_kitchen_pos_81	These screws will fit into four pre-drilled holes on the bottom of the butcher block .
4_kitchen_pos_82	You must align the screws on the cart with the holes on the butcher block as you place the butcher block on top of the cart .
4_kitchen_pos_83	Because the butcher block is so heavy ,
4_kitchen_pos_84	you may want to have help .
4_kitchen_pos_85	But what a reward it was to see the unit fully assembled and then to marvel at what a quality piece of furniture
4_kitchen_pos_86	it ended up being .
4_kitchen_pos_87	IKEA sells a similar item for twice the money .
4_kitchen_pos_88	I give the Home Styles Double Door Kitchen Cart with Butcher Block Top 5 stars
4_kitchen_pos_89	because of the beauty of the product and its better-than-a-bargain price
