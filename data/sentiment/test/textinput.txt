8_cell_neg_1	I reluctantly bought this phone
8_cell_neg_2	because my Kyocera Slider suddenly died on me conveniently
8_cell_neg_3	3 months after VM 's warranty was up
8_cell_neg_4	and i had just purchased a $ 20 phone
8_cell_neg_5	card + had airtime credits
8_cell_neg_6	which were not refundable .
8_cell_neg_7	Now i am not a teen
8_cell_neg_8	and my phone and things do not receive harsh treatment .
8_cell_neg_9	My kyocera slider actually looked like new
8_cell_neg_10	when it died with no scratches what-so-ever so i was pretty upset .
8_cell_neg_11	After multiple calls and 2 emails to VM
8_cell_neg_12	it was pretty clear they were n't going to do anything to help .
8_cell_neg_13	I was offered a replacement slider at $ 20 .
8_cell_neg_14	Obviously I did n't want the same one
8_cell_neg_15	that could possibly die on me
8_cell_neg_16	after a couple of months so like i was saying
8_cell_neg_17	I had no other recourse
8_cell_neg_18	but to purchase this Audiovox 8610 .
8_cell_neg_19	By the way AFTER
8_cell_neg_20	I PURCHASED THE PHONE AT A LOCAL STORE IN TOWN
8_cell_neg_21	-LRB-
8_cell_neg_22	when i called to activate the phone -RRB-
8_cell_neg_23	they have the nerve
8_cell_neg_24	to tell me that I could ` ve purchased the same 8610 from them at a discount price of $ 24.99
8_cell_neg_25	because the slider died .
8_cell_neg_26	The f ! @ % ng idiots ! HELLO COULD YA NOT HAVE TOLD
8_cell_neg_27	ME SOONER ? ? ?
8_cell_neg_28	and after i spent $ 50 + tax .
8_cell_neg_29	sheesh !
8_cell_neg_30	Anyway back to the phone review . .
8_cell_neg_31	the ringer is indeed low
8_cell_neg_32	as others have reported here .
8_cell_neg_33	Its so low
8_cell_neg_34	that if its in my purse i ca n't even hear it ! WTF ? ? ?
8_cell_neg_35	Also the battery life sucks , no sooner does the thing ring and the batteries at half .
8_cell_neg_36	It also doesnt get good service with the VM\/Sprint network ,
8_cell_neg_37	my slider had xcellent service w\/it
8_cell_neg_38	despite everything
8_cell_neg_39	and rarely if ever dropped calls .
8_cell_neg_40	So I ` ve had it 5 days and I 'm considering
8_cell_neg_41	attempting to bring it back
8_cell_neg_42	where I purchased it from .
8_cell_neg_43	However i do n't want to buy an expensive phone from VM
8_cell_neg_44	because I 'm seriously reconsidering continuing w\/them .
8_cell_neg_45	The way I see
8_cell_neg_46	it VM leaves alot to be desired with the quality of phones
8_cell_neg_47	they sell +
8_cell_neg_48	they are expensive .
8_cell_neg_49	I am a lite user
8_cell_neg_50	but if you talk slightly more than usual you end up
8_cell_neg_51	feeling it wallet - wise .
8_cell_neg_52	Prior to these issues
8_cell_neg_53	I was a happy VM customer but not anymore .
