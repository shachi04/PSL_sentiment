11_cell_pos_1	I purchased this Nokia 5300 Black at the T-Mobile store .
11_cell_pos_2	It does come with 1 GB memory card
11_cell_pos_3	and I was able to easily load up 160 songs last night with no problems .
11_cell_pos_4	Phone comes with USB cable to connect to your computer .
11_cell_pos_5	I have a Mac
11_cell_pos_6	so this was easy to do .
11_cell_pos_7	You will not be able to download songs
11_cell_pos_8	bought from iTunes
11_cell_pos_9	but you can load up AAC files and mp3 and mp4 .
11_cell_pos_10	You can hold up to 500 songs if they are all 3.5 minutes long and compressed to 128 kps .
11_cell_pos_11	My music is usually remixed and\/or longer than 3.5 minutes each .
11_cell_pos_12	I was n't able to sync up with Bluetooth to my iBook
11_cell_pos_13	but I was able to pair with my Motorola T305 that I will be using in my car .
11_cell_pos_14	Apple has not approved the Nokia 5300 yet to sync .
11_cell_pos_15	I am sure
11_cell_pos_16	it is a matter of time since the phone is rather new .
11_cell_pos_17	Overall ,
11_cell_pos_18	I love the feel of this phone , has wonderful 2 in screen , color is great , camera is cool ,
11_cell_pos_19	and it is very intuitive to use .
11_cell_pos_20	I have been with Samsung over the last three years
11_cell_pos_21	and I was concerned about going back to a Nokia .
11_cell_pos_22	However , the speakerphone is absolutely great compared to the Motorola 195 that I originally got but returned .
11_cell_pos_23	Once you load up your songs ,
11_cell_pos_24	the speaker is impressive .
11_cell_pos_25	This morning ,
11_cell_pos_26	I had the phone playing music in one part of the house ,
11_cell_pos_27	and I had to go get something at the other end of the house ,
11_cell_pos_28	and I could still hear the music perfectly .
11_cell_pos_29	Calling on the phone was better than expected .
11_cell_pos_30	I was talking to my friend during busy traffic and lots of people\/background noise
11_cell_pos_31	and I was able to carry on a pleasant conversation with her unlike my Samsung
11_cell_pos_32	that was difficult to do this with .
11_cell_pos_33	The phone is quite sturdy .
11_cell_pos_34	And I am happy to have a phone
11_cell_pos_35	that not everyone has - a Motorola Razor .
11_cell_pos_36	This Nokia 5300 looks a bit chucky compared to that phone
11_cell_pos_37	but I feel like I have a very unique phone
11_cell_pos_38	that is more than a phone .
11_cell_pos_39	Who needs an iPod mini
11_cell_pos_40	when you can get this and your phone all in one ?
11_cell_pos_41	I just ordered the Boxwave Frost Case for this phone .
11_cell_pos_42	There is very little to chose from at the T-Mobile store
11_cell_pos_43	as far as accessories and Nokia.com did n't have much either .
11_cell_pos_44	\*\*\*\*\*
11_cell_pos_45	The alarm feature to wake up is cool too .
11_cell_pos_46	You can choose to wake up to your favorite song that you have downloaded and you can program it to slowly increase the volume of the song for your alarm .
11_cell_pos_47	It also comes with programmable snooze .
11_cell_pos_48	What a dream !
11_cell_pos_49	\*\*\*\*\*
11_cell_pos_50	You can make calls
11_cell_pos_51	without even having to slide the phone
11_cell_pos_52	to dial .
11_cell_pos_53	As long as you have the number
11_cell_pos_54	you want already stored in your phone book ,
11_cell_pos_55	then all you have to do is look up
11_cell_pos_56	and press the green button !
11_cell_pos_57	\*\*\*\*\*
11_cell_pos_58	When you are playing your music ,
11_cell_pos_59	if an incoming call comes in ,
11_cell_pos_60	it will stop playing the song
11_cell_pos_61	and then alert you with the normal ring tone that a call is coming in .
11_cell_pos_62	Once you are done with the phone call ,
11_cell_pos_63	you can resume playing your music .
11_cell_pos_64	\*\*\*\*\*
11_cell_pos_65	As I said , this phone is a gem in all areas
11_cell_pos_66	- speaker , sturdy , colorful ,
11_cell_pos_67	I think
11_cell_pos_68	it is contemporary
11_cell_pos_69	and an acquired taste for sure but nonetheless appealing , call quality is great even in loud areas , and lots of little creature comforts .
11_cell_pos_70	Definitely consider this phone if you really like to have music
11_cell_pos_71	and bluetooth and speakerphone .
11_cell_pos_72	Else , this may not be the phone for you
