20_kitchen_pos_1	"It 's a three-piece roasting rack -- two sides and a long "" pin """
20_kitchen_pos_2	that holds them together .
20_kitchen_pos_3	When assembled
20_kitchen_pos_4	it has a rounded bottom and tall sides with handles .
20_kitchen_pos_5	It 's supposed to handle up to a 25 lb turkey ,
20_kitchen_pos_6	and
20_kitchen_pos_7	after using it with a 22 lb turkey I believe that claim .
20_kitchen_pos_8	The tall sides and handles make
20_kitchen_pos_9	it easy
20_kitchen_pos_10	to remove your turkey from your roasting pan ,
20_kitchen_pos_11	and the wide rounded base holds the turkey nicely up out of the drippings without crushing the rib cage
20_kitchen_pos_12	the way angled
20_kitchen_pos_13	racks do .
20_kitchen_pos_14	In fact , my only beef with the shape was that it was too wide to fit in our Maxam Steel Roaster ,
20_kitchen_pos_15	which is currently my favorite roasting pan .
20_kitchen_pos_16	The truly cool thing about this rack , however , is n't the handles or the shape .
20_kitchen_pos_17	It 's that nifty pin at the bottom .
20_kitchen_pos_18	You see ,
20_kitchen_pos_19	you just put your racked turkey down on its carving platter
20_kitchen_pos_20	and pull the pin ,
20_kitchen_pos_21	then
20_kitchen_pos_22	you simply remove the sides .
20_kitchen_pos_23	That 's it .
20_kitchen_pos_24	They pull right away from the turkey ,
20_kitchen_pos_25	leaving it behind on its platter .
20_kitchen_pos_26	No more trying to lever it out of your pan or off of its rack ;
20_kitchen_pos_27	it 's right
20_kitchen_pos_28	where you want it already .
20_kitchen_pos_29	For all of its non-stick properties the rack did take some real elbow-grease
20_kitchen_pos_30	to clean -- particularly
20_kitchen_pos_31	when trying to get turkey goo out of the crevices between bars --
20_kitchen_pos_32	but that is n't very surprising .
20_kitchen_pos_33	It does make
20_kitchen_pos_34	it unfortunate that the dishwasher is not recommended for this product , however .
20_kitchen_pos_35	Also ,
20_kitchen_pos_36	there is one problem
20_kitchen_pos_37	that did bother us ;
20_kitchen_pos_38	it seems
20_kitchen_pos_39	that some of the non-stick coating at the bottom of the rack flaked off during cooking .
20_kitchen_pos_40	We thought
20_kitchen_pos_41	that perhaps the initial 30 minutes at 500 F was too high a temperature for the rack ,
20_kitchen_pos_42	but there is no maximum temperature
20_kitchen_pos_43	listed on the packaging that I could find .
20_kitchen_pos_44	I 'm still giving this item a rating of four
20_kitchen_pos_45	because it 's just so incredibly cool an idea , and so remarkably useful ,
20_kitchen_pos_46	but I have to admit
20_kitchen_pos_47	that I 'm not thrilled with the idea of a non-stick coating
20_kitchen_pos_48	that flakes ,
20_kitchen_pos_49	and I wish
20_kitchen_pos_50	the item was dishwasher-safe .
20_kitchen_pos_51	I 'd love to see Cuisipro develop a version of this item
20_kitchen_pos_52	made out of a better material
