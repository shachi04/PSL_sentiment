I  did  n't  know 	0.0001

There  is  a  serious  lag  between  the  shutter  click  and  the  final  image  . 	0.1875
I  sincerely  hope  if  there  would  be  some  s\/w  patch  for  this  . 	0.1875
I  am  anyway  not  a  big  fan  of  phone  cameras  -  with  an  exception  of  Sony  Ericsson  W810i  . 	0.25
That  is  one  far  superior  camera  quality 	0.4166666666666667
I  saw  so  far  . 	0.0001
\*  Slider  lock  and  unlock  feature  is  good  and  bad  . 	0.5
I  am 	0.25
putting  this  on  the  bad  section  as  even  if  the  slider  opens  in  your  pocket  , 	0.125
the  phone  could  turn  on 	0.0001

please  do  n't  brew  it  in  your  coffee  maker 	0.0001
When  I  recieved  this  item  , 	0.0001
I  had  mixed  emotions  for  the  product  . 	0.4375
On  one  hand  , 	0.5
the  black  finish  looked  very  nice  , 	0.5625
and  the  clear  plastic  covering  protected  the  screen 	0.5
but  was  still  easy  to  read  . 	0.4375
Also  ,  all  of  the  side  buttons  are  fairly  easy  to  reach  with  average-sized  fingers 	0.3333333333333333
-LRB-  except  maybe  the  camera  button  -RRB-  , 	0.0001
so  navigating  the  phone  with  the  cover  still  closed  is  pretty  easy 	0.3333333333333333
unless  you  need 	0.25
to  use  touch  functions  or  open  the  QWERTY  keyboard  . 	0.0001
However  ,  due  to  the  padding  and  the  nature  of  the  metal  materials  ,  the  case  is  very  thick  and  bulky  - 	0.28125
when  using  the  belt  clip  ,  the  phone  sticks  out  far 	0.0001
enough  that  it  does  not  even  rest  evenly  on  your  hip  , 	0.125
but  leans  at  an  angle  . 	0.0001
BUT  ,  the  deciding  factor  in  my  two-star  rating  is  that  this  case  was  the  cause  of  the  only  two  times  I  have  dropped  my  Cingular  8525  -LRB- 	0.3125
which  at  such  a  steep  price  ,  is  not  something 	0.25
I  like  to  drop  -RRB-  . 	0.125
The  problem  lies  with  the  snap-shut  system 	0.0001
that  closes  the  case  . 	0.0001
Because  the  metal  is  so  thin  , 	0.25
it  does  not  secure  very  well  , 	0.2916666666666667
and  can  come  open  pretty  easily  . 	0.25
To  fix  this  , 	0.0001
I  simply  bent  the  piece  of  metal  downward  and  towards  the  phone  , 	0.0001
so  that  it  was  much  harder  to  both  open  and  close  the  case  . 	0.1875
This  ,  for  the  most  part  ,  solves  the  problem  , 	0.0001
but  it  is  still  dangerous 	0.25
and  caution  is  DEFINATELY  in  order  . 	0.3125
My  favorite  thing  about  this  case  is  that  you  can  open  the  case 	0.25
and  slide  the  keyboard  open  without  actually  taking  the  phone  out  of  the  case  . 	0.375
This  is  nice 	0.5625
because  it  enable  quick  replies  to  text  messages  . 	0.0001
This  is  the  only  reason 	0.25
I  did  not  give  it  a  one-star  rating  . 	0.0001
I  am  currently  looking  for  a  soft  case  ,  preferably  a  leather  sleeve  case  that  I  can  just  pull  my  phone  out  of  off  of  my  hip  , 	0.1875
rather  than  bother  with  a  clip  anymore  . 	0.5
As  a  final  warning  -  BE 	0.0001
CAREFUL  if  you  buy  this  case  . 	0.0001
Plus  , 	0.625
I  seriously  do  not  believe 	0.1875
it  is  worth  its  steep  price  point 	0.3125

granted  , 	0.375
I  `  ve  only  used  one  other 	0.0001
-LRB-  it  was  a  flimsy  little  thing 	0.25
that  came  w  \/  my  friend  's  Nokia  -RRB-  , 	0.125
but  this  one  far  surpasses  that  one  in  sound  quality  and  comfort  . 	0.375
Where  my  friend  's  would  fall  out  of  my  ear  ,  this  one 	0.125
-LRB-  once  I  got 	0.125
it  figured  out  -RRB- 	0.0001
never  comes  loose  . 	0.0001
Second  , 	0.0001
listening  to  people  on  my  friend  's  , 	0.125
I  would  have  to  turn  up  the  sound  to  hear  the  person  well  , 	0.3125
and  then  they  sounded  muffled  and  distorted  ; 	0.0001
but  on  my  Jabra 	0.0001
I  can  actually  turn  down  the  volume  on  my  phone 	0.375

it  sounds  better 	0.875
when  I  use  the  EarBoom  than  when  I  do  n't  . 	0.0001
The  ear  gels  are  a  bit  hard  to  get 	0.1875
used  to  . 	0.0001
They  are  oddly  shaped 	0.375
-LRB- 	0.0001
as  you  can  see  in  the  picture  -RRB-  , 	0.0001
and  there  are  six  of  them  total  --  three  of  them  for  each  ear  . 	0.25
Lots  of  reviewers  complained  about  the  fit  and  comfort  of  the  ear  gels  , 	0.0001
while  others  claim 	0.0001
these  are  the  most  comfortable  earpieces 	0.25
they  `  ve  used  and  that  they  fit  perfectly  .  .  . 	0.625
I  can  honesly  say 	0.0001
I  `  ve  had  both  experiences  . 	0.0001
When  I  first  got  this  unit  the  earpiece  kept  falling  out  everytime 	0.125
that  I  would  turn  my  head  : 	0.0001
\*  very  \*  frustrating  . 	0.25
I  tried 	0.0001
pushing  it  into  my  ear  as  hard  as  I  could  , 	0.0001
I  tried 	0.0001
holding  it  in  place  with  my  hand  ,  but  that  only  seemed  to  defeat  the  purpose  of  having  a  hands-free  earpiece  . 	0.375
Nothing  seemed  to  work  . 	0.25
I  was  thinking  of  returning  it  . 	0.25
I  was  thinking  of  throwing  it  into  traffic  on  I-95  . 	0.25
And  then  one  day  ,  somehow  ,  I  came  to  the  realization  that  you  have  to  sort  of  twist  it  into  your  ear  --  with  the  little  poky-out  part  stuck  in  the  fold  of  your  ear  next  to  the  ear  canal 	0.16666666666666666
-LRB-  not  the  fold  on  the  top  of  your  ear  ; 	0.125
if  you  do 	0.0001
that  it  `  ll  just  pop  out  again  -RRB-  -- 	0.0001
and  then  \*  voila  \*  it  stays  put  . 	0.0001
Matter  o  '  fact  , 	0.125
it  `  ll  stay  put  so  well  that  it  `  ll  be  a  little  bit  difficult 	0.3125
--  even  \*  painful  \*  -- 	0.125
to  get  out  again  . 	0.125
I  can  imagine  that  people  with  different  ear  sizes  ,  different  patience  levels  ,  and  lower  IQs  might  have  different  experiences  than  my  own  . 	0.5
But  all  I  can  say  is  that  once  I  had  this  little  bugger 	0.25
figured  out  , 	0.0001
I  was  golden  . 	0.25
I  love  this  thing 	0.5
and  almost  never  talk  on  the  phone  without  it  . 	0.0001
Admittedly  , 	0.0001
it  is  a  bit  difficult  to  get  into  your  ear  -- 	0.1875
I  'd  say 	0.0001
it  takes  upward  of  2  seconds  to  get  in  properly 	0.1875
-LRB-  before  you  `  re  good  and  practiced  at  it  -RRB-  , 	0.75
which  may  not  sound  like  a  lot  , 	0.0001
but  it  's  long  enough 	0.125
to  not  recognize  somebody  's  voice  or  hear  the  first  sentence  they  say  ,  or  whatever  . 	0.0001
A  \*  very  mild  \*  frustration  . 	0.1875
But  like  all  things  good  and  pleasant  , 	0.6875
it  takes  a  little  practice 	0.25
to  get  it  just  right  and  now  I  have  it  so  that  I  can  answer  the  phone  ,  slip  the  EarBoom  in  my  ear 	0.20833333333333331
and  start  a  conversation 	0.0001
without  missing  a  beat  . 	0.0001
In  fact  ,  I  find  this  earpiece  to  be  so  comfortable 	0.25
that  I  forget 	0.25
that  it  's  in  until  I  go  to  scratch  my  ear  or  something  ! 	0.0001
The  other  complaint  that  I  saw  on  here  was  that  it  's  not  compatible  with  Nokia  phones  . 	0.3333333333333333
In  fact  , 	0.0001
it  even  says 	0.125
right 	0.25
on  the  package  that  it  's  not  compatible  with  Nokia  . 	0.5
That  's  funny  , 	0.0001
I  have  a  Nokia  3589i 	0.25
and  it  works  just  fine  . 	0.0001
They  make  two  other  models  of  EarBoom 	0.0001
-LRB-  one  of  which  clearly  would  not  have  worked  with  my  phone  -RRB-  , 	0.25
both  of  which  claim  to  be  Nokia  compatible  , 	0.2916666666666667
and  \*  neither  \*  of  those  works  with  my  phone  ! 	0.0001
Confusing  ? 	0.0001
Yes  ! 	0.25
The  problem  is  it  does  n't  work  with  \*  all  \*  Nokia  phones  . 	0.25
While  browsing  at  the  store 	0.0001
I  noticed  that  the  ones 	0.0001
that  claimed  to  be  Nokia  compatible  had  a  list  of  phones 	0.3333333333333333
that  it  works  with  , 	0.0001
but  it  did  n't  include  mine 	0.0001
-LRB-  it  included  one 	0.0001
that  was  ,  numerically  speaking  ,  very  close  to  my  model  : 	0.25
the  3590  -RRB-  ; 	0.0001
which  piqued  my  curiosity  . 	0.125
And  so  I  went  to  the  friendly  manager  of  the  store  that  I  was  in  and  he  opened  two  of  the  different  packages  for  me 	0.375
and  let 	0.0001
me  test  both  of  them  . 	0.375
One  of  them  worked  ,  the  other  did  n't  . 	0.0001
The  strange  part  of  it  was  that  we  could  n't  see  a  visible  difference  in  the  two  units  .  .  . 	0.20833333333333331
and  then  one  of  us  noticed  that  on  one  of  them  the  jack  had  two  small  black  stripes  around  it 	0.1875
-LRB-  that  's  this  one  ,  and  if  you  look  closely  at  the  picture 	0.0001
you  can  see  them  -RRB-  , 	0.0001
while  the  other  one 	0.0001
-LRB-  the  one  marked  as  Nokia  compatible  -RRB- 	0.5
had  three  . 	0.25
Hmmm  .  .  . 	0.0001
Curious  . 	0.0001
So  my  advice  is  to  either  know  your  phone  well 	0.4166666666666667
-LRB-  as  in  ,  have  the  little  book  handy  -RRB- 	0.25
or  ask  for  help 	0.5
before  purchasing  . 	0.0001
All  in  all  4  of  5  stars  . 	0.0001
I  'd  give  it  5  stars  on  performance  and  comfort  , 	0.125
but  have  to  take  it  down  a  notch  for  an  extended  period  of  getting  used  to  it  and  for  confusing  packaging  . 	0.15625
Addendum  : 	0.0001
Several  months  later  the  little  piece  of  foam  has  fallen  from  the  end  of  the  boom  so  that  any  sound  from  the  wind  becomes  almost  unbearably  loud  for  the  person  at  the  other  end  .  .  . 	0.25
And  living  in  windy  Providence  , 	0.0001
this  is  a  bit  of  an  annoyance  . 	0.25
Also  ,  for  a  while 	0.0001
I  was  having  a  problem 	0.25
where  the  earpiece  would  cut  out  for  seconds  at  a  time  so  that  I  could  n't  hear  the  person  on  the  other  end  of  the  line 	0.125
-LRB-  and  ,  likewise  , 	0.0001
they  could  n't  hear  me  -RRB- 	0.0001
unless  I  jiggled  the  little  jack  . 	0.125
This  was  \*  very  \*  FRUSTRATING  . 	0.25
\*\* 	0.0001
Now  ,  for  some  reason  , 	0.0001
I  'm  not  having  that  problem  anymore  . 	0.25
I  'm  not  really  sure  if  the  problem  was  due  to  my  phone  or  the  EarBoom  . 	0.375
Either  way  ,  it  's  something  buyers  should  be  aware  of 	0.375
"It  's  a  three-piece  roasting  rack  --  two  sides  and  a  long  ""  pin  "" "	0.0001
that  holds  them  together  . 	0.0001
When  assembled 	0.0001
it  has  a  rounded  bottom  and  tall  sides  with  handles  . 	0.375
It  's  supposed  to  handle  up  to  a  25  lb  turkey  , 	0.0001
and 	0.0001
after  using  it  with  a  22  lb  turkey  I  believe  that  claim  . 	0.125
The  tall  sides  and  handles  make 	0.5
it  easy 	0.625
to  remove  your  turkey  from  your  roasting  pan  , 	0.0001
and  the  wide  rounded  base  holds  the  turkey  nicely  up  out  of  the  drippings  without  crushing  the  rib  cage 	0.25
the  way  angled 	0.0001
racks  do  . 	0.0001
In  fact  ,  my  only  beef  with  the  shape  was  that  it  was  too  wide  to  fit  in  our  Maxam  Steel  Roaster  , 	0.3125
which  is  currently  my  favorite  roasting  pan  . 	0.25
The  truly  cool  thing  about  this  rack  ,  however  ,  is  n't  the  handles  or  the  shape  . 	0.3125
It  's  that  nifty  pin  at  the  bottom  . 	0.0001
You  see  , 	0.0001
you  just  put  your  racked  turkey  down  on  its  carving  platter 	0.0001

then 	0.0001
you  simply  remove  the  sides  . 	0.0001

For  all  of  its  non-stick  properties  the  rack  did  take  some  real  elbow-grease 	0.0001
to  clean  --  particularly 	0.0001

there  is  one  problem 	0.25
that  did  bother  us  ; 	0.0001
it  seems 	0.0001
that  some  of  the  non-stick  coating  at  the  bottom  of  the  rack  flaked  off  during  cooking  . 	0.0001
We  thought 	0.0001
that  perhaps  the  initial  30  minutes  at  500  F  was  too  high  a  temperature  for  the  rack  , 	0.16666666666666666
but  there  is  no  maximum  temperature 	0.25
listed  on  the  packaging  that  I  could  find  . 	0.0001
I  'm  still  giving  this  item  a  rating  of  four 	0.0001
because  it  's  just  so  incredibly  cool  an  idea  ,  and  so  remarkably  useful  , 	0.1875

that  I  'm  not  thrilled  with  the  idea  of  a  non-stick  coating 	0.125
