2_cell_neg_1	First , let
2_cell_neg_2	me say
2_cell_neg_3	that I really wanted to like this device .
2_cell_neg_4	I had patience and understanding for a while
2_cell_neg_5	but it got me nowhere .
2_cell_neg_6	The main issue with this phone is its operating system :
2_cell_neg_7	Windows Mobile 5.0 .
2_cell_neg_8	This OS is a piece of fluff garbage .
2_cell_neg_9	Simple things that should take a click or two have become so difficult
2_cell_neg_10	to access that you basically just give up .
2_cell_neg_11	Main Gripes
2_cell_neg_12	-----------
2_cell_neg_13	Connectivity with T-Mobile is horrible :
2_cell_neg_14	accessing the aim function does n't work 9 times out of 10 .
2_cell_neg_15	E-mail functions are useless .
2_cell_neg_16	I tried
2_cell_neg_17	finding a solution for hours and the best I got was having my email
2_cell_neg_18	checked every hour
2_cell_neg_19	but deleted shortly after that .
2_cell_neg_20	Internet explorer can NEVER find the page that I 'm looking for and consistently tells me to try again .
2_cell_neg_21	Even when connected to wi-fi this happens .
2_cell_neg_22	Let me tell you also that this device does not let you choose between wi-fi and edge .
2_cell_neg_23	If you already opened IE and you were using EDGE then it will continue to use EDGE
2_cell_neg_24	unless you restart the phone with wi-fi enabled .
2_cell_neg_25	Calls
2_cell_neg_26	-----
2_cell_neg_27	Making a call was so difficult that I wanted to smash the phone on a daily basis .
2_cell_neg_28	Usually ,
2_cell_neg_29	I would press talk
2_cell_neg_30	to dial a call
2_cell_neg_31	"and it would immediately say "" Call Ended . """
2_cell_neg_32	It 's as if the device does n't even want to try .
2_cell_neg_33	Also ,
2_cell_neg_34	when answering a call , well trying to answer a call ,
2_cell_neg_35	it would drop it as soon as I pressed talk .
2_cell_neg_36	What the HELL is THAT ! ?
2_cell_neg_37	What good is a phone
2_cell_neg_38	if you ca n't make or receive calls ?
2_cell_neg_39	Keep in mind this happens around half the time .
2_cell_neg_40	Also keep in mind that I live in NEW YORK CITY !
2_cell_neg_41	My calls should not be dropping except for when I 'm in the subway .
2_cell_neg_42	The side volume button is extremely annoying causing the volume
2_cell_neg_43	to go to both extremes within one conversation .
2_cell_neg_44	Not only that ,
2_cell_neg_45	but when you disable it ,
2_cell_neg_46	you have no other method of changing the volume on the device .
2_cell_neg_47	ARGGGHHH !
2_cell_neg_48	Keyboard
2_cell_neg_49	-------
2_cell_neg_50	While the keyboard is basically easy to type on , the phone is buggy .
2_cell_neg_51	First off , the t9 sucks !
2_cell_neg_52	It will completely change the word
2_cell_neg_53	you are typing to a word
2_cell_neg_54	that 's in its dictionary
2_cell_neg_55	while you ` re typing !
2_cell_neg_56	EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING !
2_cell_neg_57	Now get this ,
2_cell_neg_58	you ca n't even permanently keep the t9 off .
2_cell_neg_59	So you have to keep going into the menu
2_cell_neg_60	to change it to normal ABC mode .
2_cell_neg_61	While I appreciate the ability to have faster typing , is n't the whole point of a QWERTY
2_cell_neg_62	being able to type without using t9 ?
2_cell_neg_63	"When you actually get to typing , sometimes , the keys will "" stick """
2_cell_neg_64	and a character will continuously repeat until you stop it .
2_cell_neg_65	This is n't a physical keyboard issue but yet another software issue .
2_cell_neg_66	Programs
2_cell_neg_67	-------
2_cell_neg_68	For all
2_cell_neg_69	you techno oriented people out there
2_cell_neg_70	-LRB- basically everyone buying this phone -RRB- ,
2_cell_neg_71	the programs this device has available for download are minuscule .
2_cell_neg_72	Not only is the catalog of programs extremely limited
2_cell_neg_73	but when using a JAVA program
2_cell_neg_74	-LRB-
2_cell_neg_75	which most programs are coded in -RRB-
2_cell_neg_76	the Dash 's JAVA program will not allow
2_cell_neg_77	you
2_cell_neg_78	to open those programs .
2_cell_neg_79	I ALWAYS get an error
2_cell_neg_80	"stating "" A Java midlet is not responding """
2_cell_neg_81	It then gives me the choice of waiting or killing the app .
2_cell_neg_82	Neither of which solve
2_cell_neg_83	anything .
2_cell_neg_84	This phone is so useless
2_cell_neg_85	it 's beyond words .
2_cell_neg_86	I could go on and on about it 's issues
2_cell_neg_87	but I really do n't care to .
2_cell_neg_88	STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE !
2_cell_neg_89	While T-mobile customer support is very helpful and friendly ,
2_cell_neg_90	their service\/coverage is non-existent .
2_cell_neg_91	Calls are constantly dropped ,
2_cell_neg_92	I get voice mails
2_cell_neg_93	without the phone even ringing ,
2_cell_neg_94	and internet connectivity is never really available .
2_cell_neg_95	Please , do yourself a favor
2_cell_neg_96	and wait for the iPhone .
