5_gourmet_neg_1	The product description says
5_gourmet_neg_2	that this tea is ' slightly sweet ' as well as a bunch of other descriptors ,
5_gourmet_neg_3	but I did n't get any sweetness at all .
5_gourmet_neg_4	I was very optimistic
5_gourmet_neg_5	because I normally love everything Tazo offers ,
5_gourmet_neg_6	but this time I had my hopes
5_gourmet_neg_7	dashed .
5_gourmet_neg_8	I brewed up a mug of this tea
5_gourmet_neg_9	and was immediately alarmed at the bouquet .
5_gourmet_neg_10	The teabag smelled different ,
5_gourmet_neg_11	but once the hot water hit it the smell seemed to really magnify .
5_gourmet_neg_12	But I scooped in a few teaspoons of sugar
5_gourmet_neg_13	and hoped for the best .
5_gourmet_neg_14	I managed to choke down about a third of the cup
5_gourmet_neg_15	before I called it a day .
5_gourmet_neg_16	Life is too short to drink something
5_gourmet_neg_17	you do n't like .
5_gourmet_neg_18	However ,
5_gourmet_neg_19	I had read a review
5_gourmet_neg_20	that mentioned
5_gourmet_neg_21	how good and palatable this tea was
5_gourmet_neg_22	when combined with the Tazo Lotus .
5_gourmet_neg_23	I figured
5_gourmet_neg_24	it was worth a shot , otherwise
5_gourmet_neg_25	I 'd have to throw out this tea altogether .
5_gourmet_neg_26	The Lotus smelled great ,
5_gourmet_neg_27	so I was excited .
5_gourmet_neg_28	I blended the two bags
5_gourmet_neg_29	-LRB- one Lotus and one Wild Sweet Orange -RRB-
5_gourmet_neg_30	in a large mug ,
5_gourmet_neg_31	then removed the Wild Sweet Orange after a minute .
5_gourmet_neg_32	I left the Lotus in for another minute or two
5_gourmet_neg_33	-LRB- yeah , definitely two -RRB- .
5_gourmet_neg_34	The result was a very unusual ,
5_gourmet_neg_35	but not unappealing ,
5_gourmet_neg_36	beverage .
5_gourmet_neg_37	Would I drink this more than once a day ?
5_gourmet_neg_38	No .
5_gourmet_neg_39	Was it very interesting and something that
5_gourmet_neg_40	I ` ll try again ?
5_gourmet_neg_41	Yes .
5_gourmet_neg_42	Live and learn ,
5_gourmet_neg_43	I guess .
