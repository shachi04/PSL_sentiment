19_kitchen_pos_1	This is the best , most beloved item in my kitchen ! ! !
19_kitchen_pos_2	I only wish I had bought the grinder and all the different cups
19_kitchen_pos_3	-LRB-
19_kitchen_pos_4	which I am going to now add on -RRB- .
19_kitchen_pos_5	I read some of the other reviews -- and at first I was also disappointed with this blender .
19_kitchen_pos_6	Now that I have learned
19_kitchen_pos_7	how to use it ,
19_kitchen_pos_8	I LOVE IT ! ! !
19_kitchen_pos_9	DO NOT put Protein powder into it first ,
19_kitchen_pos_10	it will get stuck in the bottom of the cup
19_kitchen_pos_11	which you invert onto the blades
19_kitchen_pos_12	-LRB-
19_kitchen_pos_13	When you invert it ,
19_kitchen_pos_14	the bottom becomes the top -RRB- .
19_kitchen_pos_15	If you put liquid in first and then the powder
19_kitchen_pos_16	there 's no problem .
19_kitchen_pos_17	You have to learn
19_kitchen_pos_18	how to use it .
19_kitchen_pos_19	You will want to put the frozen fruit in last if you are making something really thick .
19_kitchen_pos_20	I read the reviews here
19_kitchen_pos_21	before I bought mine
19_kitchen_pos_22	and a woman said
19_kitchen_pos_23	hers was junk
19_kitchen_pos_24	but I went ahead
19_kitchen_pos_25	and read the rest of the reviews
19_kitchen_pos_26	and decided to buy it .
19_kitchen_pos_27	If mine breaks in a year ,
19_kitchen_pos_28	it will have been well worth the price .
19_kitchen_pos_29	I use it every day
19_kitchen_pos_30	and sometimes three times a day .
19_kitchen_pos_31	On a hot day
19_kitchen_pos_32	when I want something slushy and cold ,
19_kitchen_pos_33	I ` ll put in orange juice with some strawberries and ice --
19_kitchen_pos_34	in a flash
19_kitchen_pos_35	you have a refreshing drink .
19_kitchen_pos_36	It 's fabulous .
19_kitchen_pos_37	I could use my Cuisinart ,
19_kitchen_pos_38	but this blender is so easy and quiet by comparison .
19_kitchen_pos_39	There are no buttons
19_kitchen_pos_40	to push ,
19_kitchen_pos_41	you just fill the cup with your juice
19_kitchen_pos_42	-LRB- I often add protein powder -RRB-
19_kitchen_pos_43	and something frozen
19_kitchen_pos_44	-LRB- Ice or frozen fruit -RRB-
19_kitchen_pos_45	and screw on the lid
19_kitchen_pos_46	-LRB-
19_kitchen_pos_47	which have blades in it -RRB-
19_kitchen_pos_48	and put it on the blending base and twist .
19_kitchen_pos_49	You can either twist and pusle it , or twist
19_kitchen_pos_50	and leave it to blend on its own .
19_kitchen_pos_51	Then you take the lid off , rinse ,
19_kitchen_pos_52	and that 's it .
19_kitchen_pos_53	I love hummus
19_kitchen_pos_54	and I will never make it in the blender
19_kitchen_pos_55	because you have to dig it out
19_kitchen_pos_56	and most of it gets left behind .
19_kitchen_pos_57	With this gadget ,
19_kitchen_pos_58	you fill the cup , blend it ,
19_kitchen_pos_59	then screw off the blade lid , screw on the refrigerator lid , and
19_kitchen_pos_60	that 's it .
19_kitchen_pos_61	Nothing to scrape , just put it in the refrigerator .
19_kitchen_pos_62	-LRB- Oh yes ,
19_kitchen_pos_63	you do have to rinse off the blade lid , that 's the whole clean-up -RRB- .
19_kitchen_pos_64	If you like frozen drinks or sauces you blend , this is a great gadget ! ! !
19_kitchen_pos_65	I live in two places
19_kitchen_pos_66	and I am getting another one for the other place ,
19_kitchen_pos_67	but I 'm buying the complete set this time
