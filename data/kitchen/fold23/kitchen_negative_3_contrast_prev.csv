3_kitchen_neg_1	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_0	My wife got this Cuisinart Classic Toaster oven as a wedding gift .
3_kitchen_neg_2	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_1	We liked the appearance
3_kitchen_neg_3	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_2	and had it on our registry .
3_kitchen_neg_4	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_3	We used this toaster oven a lot
3_kitchen_neg_5	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_4	because it cooked very well .
3_kitchen_neg_6	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_5	Toast was perfect ,
3_kitchen_neg_7	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_6	and the oven
3_kitchen_neg_8	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_7	cooked nice and hot .
3_kitchen_neg_9	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_8	We broiled meats
3_kitchen_neg_10	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_9	and made all kind of things in it .
3_kitchen_neg_11	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_10	We found it hard to clean .
3_kitchen_neg_12	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_11	We would take the baking pan\/and crumb tray
3_kitchen_neg_13	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_12	and use our regular self
3_kitchen_neg_14	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_13	cleaning oven
3_kitchen_neg_15	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_14	to clean those ,
3_kitchen_neg_16	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_15	but it would take a lot of scrubbing to clean the glass and interior of the oven .
3_kitchen_neg_17	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_16	Then after about 1 year one of the plastic feet broke off
3_kitchen_neg_18	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_17	when simply adjusting the position of the oven on the counter .
3_kitchen_neg_19	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_18	I glued
3_kitchen_neg_20	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_19	it back on with super glue .
3_kitchen_neg_21	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_20	It broke again
3_kitchen_neg_22	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_21	and seemed to become more brittle over time because of the heat so I had to fix this plastic foot a few times .
3_kitchen_neg_23	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_22	Then another problem arose .
3_kitchen_neg_24	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_23	The toaster and the one light would shut off a few second after pressing start .
3_kitchen_neg_25	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_24	So to make toast
3_kitchen_neg_26	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_25	we just used the un-timed bake function ,
3_kitchen_neg_27	negative	True	3_kitchen_neg_26	but then we would have to watch so we did not burn the toast .
3_kitchen_neg_28	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_27	Still we lived with it .
3_kitchen_neg_29	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_28	Then after about another four months all of the controls stopped working .
3_kitchen_neg_30	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_29	So it does not bake .
3_kitchen_neg_31	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_30	I think
3_kitchen_neg_32	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_31	I knew
3_kitchen_neg_33	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_32	this was going to happen
3_kitchen_neg_34	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_33	because I would hear a strange buzz
3_kitchen_neg_35	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_34	and see a little smoke come off
3_kitchen_neg_36	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_35	when ever I turned the dial
3_kitchen_neg_37	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_36	to bake for a while .
3_kitchen_neg_38	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_37	So therefore I think
3_kitchen_neg_39	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_38	the electrical wiring was not heavy duty enough or the electrical system was not soldered well or protected well enough to last .
3_kitchen_neg_40	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_39	I would have expected better quality .
3_kitchen_neg_41	negative	True	3_kitchen_neg_40	Considering how long we have been making toaster ovens ,
3_kitchen_neg_42	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_41	I think
3_kitchen_neg_43	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_42	that it would have not been too hard for them to have made a more heavy duty electrical system for the controls .
3_kitchen_neg_44	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_43	So like other reviews say ,
3_kitchen_neg_45	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_44	it does cook well and evenly ,
3_kitchen_neg_46	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_45	but it is hard to clean and does not last .
3_kitchen_neg_47	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_46	If I were to have rated the product before the problems started I would have given it 4 stars .
3_kitchen_neg_48	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_47	I wish that Amazon and these sites had a section for long term reviews
3_kitchen_neg_49	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_48	that would rate the quality ,
3_kitchen_neg_50	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_49	because most of the reviews seem to be written soon after receiving the products .
3_kitchen_neg_51	negative	True	3_kitchen_neg_50	We are now looking into T-Fall Convection Toaster oven ,
3_kitchen_neg_52	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_51	but after reading those reviews
3_kitchen_neg_53	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_52	we do not know if it cooks as hot as this oven
3_kitchen_neg_54	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_53	and we want to get one
3_kitchen_neg_55	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_54	that cooks well
3_kitchen_neg_56	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_55	and lasts .
3_kitchen_neg_57	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_56	______________
3_kitchen_neg_58	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_57	Since writing my review above
3_kitchen_neg_59	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_58	I tried to fix my oven to no avail ,
3_kitchen_neg_60	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_59	but I have gained more insight into its design
3_kitchen_neg_61	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_60	and perhaps
3_kitchen_neg_62	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_61	why it broke .
3_kitchen_neg_63	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_62	My recommendations are as follows .
3_kitchen_neg_64	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_63	Since I know
3_kitchen_neg_65	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_64	"that the rotary controls and the circuit board of this "" Classic "" model product can over time get dirty and stop working ,"
3_kitchen_neg_66	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_65	I recommend that people who own this oven keep it far away from any other cooking products
3_kitchen_neg_67	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_66	that create grease or steam such as range tops , rice cookers , deep fryers , pressure cookers , or kitchen sinks .
3_kitchen_neg_68	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_67	Especially keep the vents near the controls on the right side of this unit away from these sources of moisture and grease .
3_kitchen_neg_69	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_68	I recommend consumers to consider the newer models with digital controls ,
3_kitchen_neg_70	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_69	which might have a different mechanism inside or the models with the controls beneath
3_kitchen_neg_71	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_70	and therefore the electrical components
3_kitchen_neg_72	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_71	and cooling vents underneath the oven and not in an exposed location .
3_kitchen_neg_73	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_72	This might make the unit last longer .
3_kitchen_neg_74	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_73	The newer Cuisinart models with the knobs or digital controls beneath the oven might be a design improvement to correct the sort of problem
3_kitchen_neg_75	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_74	I had .
3_kitchen_neg_76	negative	True	3_kitchen_neg_75	Or perhaps other manufactures have solved electrical component problem other ways .
3_kitchen_neg_77	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_76	Maybe 1.5 years is average life , or maybe the fact
3_kitchen_neg_78	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_77	that my oven was placed near the cooking range in my kitchen
3_kitchen_neg_79	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_78	made my unit more susceptible to malfunction .
3_kitchen_neg_80	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_79	Reviews of lots of other brand models show short life spans for these products .
3_kitchen_neg_81	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_80	From the reviews and my observations above ,
3_kitchen_neg_82	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_81	I think
3_kitchen_neg_83	positive	False	3_kitchen_neg_82	the Krups models and the improved Cuisinart models might last a longer time than this classic model
3_kitchen_neg_84	negative	False	3_kitchen_neg_83	that died on me .
