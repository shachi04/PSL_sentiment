5_kitchen_pos_1	Le Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products .
5_kitchen_pos_2	The enameled cookware is cast from molten iron
5_kitchen_pos_3	formed in sand moulds
5_kitchen_pos_4	which are used only once .
5_kitchen_pos_5	For this reason , one pan may look like another ,
5_kitchen_pos_6	but each is unique in its own way .
5_kitchen_pos_7	Cast iron is a highly efficient material
5_kitchen_pos_8	which absorbs and distributes heat efficiently .
5_kitchen_pos_9	For this reason ,
5_kitchen_pos_10	it is recommended to use on low to medium heat .
5_kitchen_pos_11	There are a few exceptions like boiling water
5_kitchen_pos_12	where cooking on high heat is appropriate and okay .
5_kitchen_pos_13	Otherwise , cooking with high heat may cause food
5_kitchen_pos_14	to stick , discolor the enamel coating , or cook the food unevenly .
5_kitchen_pos_15	Remove cast iron from the heat
5_kitchen_pos_16	and it does not cool off quickly .
5_kitchen_pos_17	This helps your food stay warm while serving .
5_kitchen_pos_18	Beware ;
5_kitchen_pos_19	iron tends to be heavy
5_kitchen_pos_20	so these cooking vessels tend to be heavy as well .
5_kitchen_pos_21	Cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel ?
5_kitchen_pos_22	Iron tends to rust ;
5_kitchen_pos_23	iron oxide
5_kitchen_pos_24	-LRB- rust -RRB-
5_kitchen_pos_25	does n't add any complimentary flavors to your food .
5_kitchen_pos_26	If your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled ,
5_kitchen_pos_27	you would have to season
5_kitchen_pos_28	and maintain it .
5_kitchen_pos_29	Adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good ,
5_kitchen_pos_30	but has multiple benefits .
5_kitchen_pos_31	The enamel ,
5_kitchen_pos_32	being a solid coating , is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on ,
5_kitchen_pos_33	does not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors ,
5_kitchen_pos_34	and is easy to clean .
5_kitchen_pos_35	The enamel can be damaged , so limit cooking tools to plastic or wood .
5_kitchen_pos_36	The benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many ,
5_kitchen_pos_37	but lets get down to the roasting pan specifically .
5_kitchen_pos_38	This pan holds 5 1\/4 quarts of food , measures 9 3\/4 x 14 x 3 inches internally , and weighs 10.2 pounds .
5_kitchen_pos_39	5 1\/4 quarts will typically feed 8 - 10 people
5_kitchen_pos_40	when it comes to casseroles , so consider your recipes
5_kitchen_pos_41	when determining the size
5_kitchen_pos_42	you need .
5_kitchen_pos_43	Except for roasts , the roasting pan tends to do best if at least 3\/4 full .
5_kitchen_pos_44	Any less
5_kitchen_pos_45	and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot .
5_kitchen_pos_46	I find that the cast iron adds a crispy texture to food
5_kitchen_pos_47	that may be desirable with a dish like mac-n-cheese ,
5_kitchen_pos_48	while not so desirable for other dishes .
5_kitchen_pos_49	Add the Le Creuset 9 x 11 1\/2 inch roasting rack for roasting chickens and pork loins
5_kitchen_pos_50	keeping them out of the grease .
5_kitchen_pos_51	Some other possibilities for this pan include casseroles , pork chops
5_kitchen_pos_52	covered with cornbread dressing , dinner rolls , baked squash , lasagna , scalloped potatoes , cobblers , pineapple upside down cake , or bread pudding .
5_kitchen_pos_53	The possibilities almost seem endless to your imagination .
5_kitchen_pos_54	One feature that people tend to complain about is the cost .
5_kitchen_pos_55	The cost does seem steep
5_kitchen_pos_56	compared to other pans
5_kitchen_pos_57	made from other materials .
5_kitchen_pos_58	Heck , cast iron does n't seem like it should be expensive
5_kitchen_pos_59	when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping .
5_kitchen_pos_60	However the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced .
5_kitchen_pos_61	They then go through the enameling process
5_kitchen_pos_62	before shipping these heavy pans .
5_kitchen_pos_63	If you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products ,
5_kitchen_pos_64	the cost tends to make sense .
5_kitchen_pos_65	Then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime
5_kitchen_pos_66	when taken care of .
5_kitchen_pos_67	PROS :
5_kitchen_pos_68	Extremely versatile
5_kitchen_pos_69	Efficient absorption and distribution of heat
5_kitchen_pos_70	Hygienic enamel cooking surface
5_kitchen_pos_71	Does not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavors
5_kitchen_pos_72	Easy to clean
5_kitchen_pos_73	when not abused or misused
5_kitchen_pos_74	Can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table
5_kitchen_pos_75	Can easily last a lifetime
5_kitchen_pos_76	CONS :
5_kitchen_pos_77	Its heavy , as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 10.2 pounds
