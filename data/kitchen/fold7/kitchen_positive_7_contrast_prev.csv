7_kitchen_pos_54	positive	False	7_kitchen_pos_53	I am
7_kitchen_pos_55	positive	False	7_kitchen_pos_54	giving this machine 4 stars

7_kitchen_pos_57	positive	False	7_kitchen_pos_56	it does what it was designed to do . . . light cleaning .
7_kitchen_pos_58	negative	False	7_kitchen_pos_57	I would have given it 5 stars
7_kitchen_pos_59	negative	False	7_kitchen_pos_58	if the cleaning solution bucket was larger
7_kitchen_pos_60	negative	False	7_kitchen_pos_59	and the cut off mechanism was a little more liberal and a little more suction power
7_kitchen_pos_61	negative	False	7_kitchen_pos_60	would have been nice .
7_kitchen_pos_62	positive	False	7_kitchen_pos_61	When Hoover finally comes up with a heavy duty scrubber with the suction power of a regular vacuum ,
7_kitchen_pos_63	positive	False	7_kitchen_pos_62	scrubbing power of my own elbow and ability to get into corners and baseboards I ` ll be all over it !
7_kitchen_pos_64	positive	False	7_kitchen_pos_63	Until then ,
7_kitchen_pos_65	positive	False	7_kitchen_pos_64	I ` ll settle for a daily scrub with this machine and a good hand scrub once a month .
