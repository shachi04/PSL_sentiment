11_kitchen_neg_1	I own the graphite style of this set .
11_kitchen_neg_2	I was originally very happy with the purchase
11_kitchen_neg_3	-
11_kitchen_neg_4	the set looked great , did n't chip easily , and was a great size .
11_kitchen_neg_5	After a year of use
11_kitchen_neg_6	I ` ve come up with a list of problems :
11_kitchen_neg_7	The clear glazed surface on the plates and bowls can be scored by utensils
11_kitchen_neg_8	which allows water\/dirt to penetrate to the porous ceramic below leaving stains
11_kitchen_neg_9	that can not be removed .
11_kitchen_neg_10	"The semi-matte finish acquires a "" powdery "" , almost bleached , look to it after many washings"
11_kitchen_neg_11	-LRB- says dishwasher safe ,
11_kitchen_neg_12	guess
11_kitchen_neg_13	that means the colors do n't wash away immediately -RRB-
11_kitchen_neg_14	My biggest complaint :
11_kitchen_neg_15	We bought these
11_kitchen_neg_16	"because they were "" microwave safe "" ."
11_kitchen_neg_17	I do n't know what microwave safe means to most people ,
11_kitchen_neg_18	but it means to me that I could put a plate , bowl or cup in the microwave , heat up the contents ,
11_kitchen_neg_19	and then safely remove the object
11_kitchen_neg_20	and use it .
11_kitchen_neg_21	In the case of the set
11_kitchen_neg_22	I purchased ,
11_kitchen_neg_23	it only seems to mean
11_kitchen_neg_24	that the item
11_kitchen_neg_25	placed in the microwave will not explode .
11_kitchen_neg_26	Unfortunately in the case of the Sango Graphite set ,
11_kitchen_neg_27	it means that the contents of the set are sheilded by the
11_kitchen_neg_28	-LRB- plate\/bowl\/cup -RRB-
11_kitchen_neg_29	and that the contents will emerge warm
11_kitchen_neg_30	at best while you burn your hand
11_kitchen_neg_31	attempting to extract the
11_kitchen_neg_32	-LRB- plate\/bowl\/cup -RRB-
11_kitchen_neg_33	that has soaked all of the energy up from the microwave .
11_kitchen_neg_34	They get VERY hot !
11_kitchen_neg_35	-LRB- Cup of water
11_kitchen_neg_36	heated for 2 mins results in water temperature of 120F
11_kitchen_neg_37	while cup surface is 170F ! -RRB-
11_kitchen_neg_38	I ` ve only broken 2 items from the set , both times
11_kitchen_neg_39	I dropped the items after getting them partly out of the microwave
11_kitchen_neg_40	and realizing
11_kitchen_neg_41	that my fingers were being burned
11_kitchen_neg_42	-LRB- first time I thought
11_kitchen_neg_43	it was a fluke , second time
11_kitchen_neg_44	I learned my lesson -RRB-
11_kitchen_neg_45	and dropped the item on the hard stove surface below the microwave .
11_kitchen_neg_46	I emailed Sango several times
11_kitchen_neg_47	and received no response at all .
11_kitchen_neg_48	While I liked the set a lot initially ,
11_kitchen_neg_49	I have been very disappointed over time with its quality .
11_kitchen_neg_50	I will never purchase another from Sango again
