7_kitchen_pos_1	I read the reviews
7_kitchen_pos_2	before I purchased this machine .
7_kitchen_pos_3	I know from experience that reviews are extremely subjective and often times people misuse the appliance or simply expect more than a machine is capable of .
7_kitchen_pos_4	So with this in mind
7_kitchen_pos_5	I will put in my 2 cents .
7_kitchen_pos_6	I have had my machine for two months and I use it about 4 times a week on a 200 square foot vinyl kitchen floor that accomodates two adults , a 4 year old
7_kitchen_pos_7	and two dogs .
7_kitchen_pos_8	Generally it works pretty well and is much more convenient than a regular mop and bucket .
7_kitchen_pos_9	You must remember that this is a low cost residential machine
7_kitchen_pos_10	and as such will not replace the suction and scrubbing power of a serious vacuum and elbow grease .
7_kitchen_pos_11	The machine is set up to auto-shut off
7_kitchen_pos_12	if you move the machine quickly or drop it down low .
7_kitchen_pos_13	I agree with with the other writers about the poor suction capability
7_kitchen_pos_14	but you must consider the overall design of the machine .
7_kitchen_pos_15	A powerful adjustable head machine
7_kitchen_pos_16	that would pick up more than dog hair and dust would be cost prohibitive .
7_kitchen_pos_17	I see
7_kitchen_pos_18	what Hoover was trying to do with this machine .
7_kitchen_pos_19	They were trying to accomodate our scrubbing
7_kitchen_pos_20	and vacuuming needs in one cost effective machine .
7_kitchen_pos_21	They gave it a good shot
7_kitchen_pos_22	but for all of us clean-freaks this machine does n't quite hit the mark .
7_kitchen_pos_23	The water\/cleaning solution section is , in my humble opinion , to small .
7_kitchen_pos_24	I run out of water quickly
7_kitchen_pos_25	and I have a very small kitchen .
7_kitchen_pos_26	But the good news is that my kitchen is so small
7_kitchen_pos_27	I can take three steps over to the sink
7_kitchen_pos_28	and fill it up .
7_kitchen_pos_29	: -RRB-
7_kitchen_pos_30	One more comment
7_kitchen_pos_31	before I give my final review . . .
7_kitchen_pos_32	remember to follow the instructions
7_kitchen_pos_33	and use ONLY
7_kitchen_pos_34	the kind of cleaners Hoover recommends .
7_kitchen_pos_35	There 's a reason for this .
7_kitchen_pos_36	If you use regular household cleaners
7_kitchen_pos_37	that cut crease you will damage your machine
7_kitchen_pos_38	and it will most certainly leak and die !
7_kitchen_pos_39	The grease cutting agents in regular household cleaners and soaps strip the bearings
7_kitchen_pos_40	and fry the gaskets .
7_kitchen_pos_41	So my final opinion is this .
7_kitchen_pos_42	If you have a relatively small space
7_kitchen_pos_43	and need a daily quick scrub
7_kitchen_pos_44	it 's a great time saver .
7_kitchen_pos_45	It 's a good overall cleaner if you need a quick vac-up of dog hair , scrub and mop .
7_kitchen_pos_46	Any more heavy duty than that
7_kitchen_pos_47	and you are back to the good old vacuum attachment , mop and bucket routine .
7_kitchen_pos_48	If you are a cleanfreak , like me ,
7_kitchen_pos_49	you know that nothing replaces a good old fashioned hand-and-knees scrub .
7_kitchen_pos_50	No machine will ever leave you satisfied .
7_kitchen_pos_51	This machine was definately NOT made for heavy duty cleaning
7_kitchen_pos_52	but for light daily use
7_kitchen_pos_53	it 's great .
7_kitchen_pos_54	I am
7_kitchen_pos_55	giving this machine 4 stars
7_kitchen_pos_56	because I think
7_kitchen_pos_57	it does what it was designed to do . . . light cleaning .
7_kitchen_pos_58	I would have given it 5 stars
7_kitchen_pos_59	if the cleaning solution bucket was larger
7_kitchen_pos_60	and the cut off mechanism was a little more liberal and a little more suction power
7_kitchen_pos_61	would have been nice .
7_kitchen_pos_62	When Hoover finally comes up with a heavy duty scrubber with the suction power of a regular vacuum ,
7_kitchen_pos_63	scrubbing power of my own elbow and ability to get into corners and baseboards I ` ll be all over it !
7_kitchen_pos_64	Until then ,
7_kitchen_pos_65	I ` ll settle for a daily scrub with this machine and a good hand scrub once a month .
