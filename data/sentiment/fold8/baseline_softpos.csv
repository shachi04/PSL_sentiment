I  had  heard 	0.25
a  lot  of  people  say 	0.0001
that  Motorola  's  hardware  was  very  good  , 	0.4166666666666667
but  that  their  software  left  a  lot  to  be  desired  . 	0.25
Nonetheless  I  decided  to  try  this  phone  out 	0.125
when  it  came  time  to  start  a  new  cell  plan  . 	0.375
I  had  made  the  decision 	0.25
to  switch  to  T-mobile 	0.0001
and  this  looked  like  one  of  the  best  phone  options  . 	0.75
Right  off  the  bat 	0.25
I  found  out 	0.0001
that  the  people  who  criticized  Moto  's  software  were  right  on  the  money  . 	0.25
There  are  a  host  of  poorly  designed  software  aspects  of  this  phone  ,  not  the  least  of  which  is  the  --  frankly  --  idiotic  way 	0.2916666666666667
the  phone  book  is  designed  . 	0.25
Eventually  I  made  peace  with  all  of  the  things 	0.125
I  disliked  about  the  V360  since  at  least  it  seemed  to  work  well  enough  as  a  phone  . 	0.25
As  time  went  by  I  started  noticing 	0.0001
that  I  was  missing  a  lot  of  calls  . 	0.25
The  phone  would  be  in  my  bag  or  in  my  pocket  or  sitting  on  my  desk 	0.25
when  suddenly  it  would  ring  with  the  voicemail  notification  from  a  message  that  I  had  received  anywhere  from  minutes 	0.25
to  hours 	0.0001
before  . 	0.0001
During  the  course  of  the  last  few  months 	0.0001
-LRB-  the  phone  is  less  than  a  year  old  -RRB- 	0.3125
I  `  ve  also  found  that  it  has  begun 	0.25
crashing  . 	0.0001
A  lot  . 	0.0001
"Opening  or  closing  it  will  result  in  a  ""  white  screen  of  death  .  "" "	0.0001
Putting  it  on  the  charger  will  cause  it  to  switch  back  and  forth  between  the  messages  that  it  is  charging  , 	0.1875
that  it  is  unable  to  charge  and  that  it  's  SIM  card  can  not  be  found  , 	0.25
after  a  few  minutes 	0.0001
of  which  it  will  simply  shut  itself  off  . 	0.0001
With  a  full  battery  charge  it  will  continually  shut  itself  off  . 	0.125
At  this  point  I  am 	0.25
forced  to  conclude 	0.375
that  this  phone  is  an  absolute  piece  of  junk  . 	0.375
I  am  also  forced  to  conclude 	0.3125
that  it  is  n't  the  only  model 	0.25
which  is  . 	0.25
None  of  my  coworkers  has  ever  had  a  good  experience  with  a  Motorola  phone  . 	0.4166666666666667
My  wife  's  Motorola  has  shown  its  own  host  of  problems  . 	0.25
People  working  for  T-mobile  at  several  stores 	0.0001
I  have  visited  have  confided 	0.25
that  they  never  ,  ever  recommend  Motorola  phones  to  anyone  . 	0.0001
In  fact 	0.0001
I  `  ve  had  T-mobile  employees  urge 	0.0001
me  to  not  buy  any  phones  from  them  , 	0.0001
but  rather  to  shop  for  an  unlocked  Nokia  online  . 	0.5
So  that  's  what  I  'm  going  to  do  . 	0.0001
Until  I  can  buy  a  new  phone 	0.375
all  I  can  do  is  recharge  this  phone  every  night  ,  restart  it  five  or  six  times  a  day  , 	0.375
and  keep  apologizing  to  my  friends  ,  family  and  employers  for  always  missing  their  calls 	0.125
So  I  bought  this  thing 	0.0001
based  on  the  Amazon  reviews 	0.125
and  saved  a  bundle  over  the  local  retail  cost 	0.5
-LRB-  yeah  Amazon  !  -RRB-  , 	0.125
but  that  's  not 	0.0001
why  I  'm  writing  this  review  . 	0.125
I  'd  like  to  talk  about  the  performance  and  comfort  of  the  Earboom  . 	0.125
The  eargel  thingies  are  designed  quite  well  ,  of  the  three  different  sizes  for  each  ear 	0.34375
you  `  re  bound  to  find  one 	0.0001
that  fits  very  comfortably  . 	0.5
Turns  out  I  could  n't  find  any 	0.0001
that  fit  my  right  ear  comfortably  for  extended  periods  of  use 	0.125
but  found  a  perfect  fit  in  my  mate  on  the  other  side  . 	0.0001
My  wife  had  the  exact  opposite  experience  -  hopefully  our  daughter  will  inherit  more  symmetrical  ears  ! 	0.375
I  hate  jogging  so  ca  n't  comment  on  the  fit  during  that  activity 	0.125
but  can  say  the  gels  fit 	0.75
suprising  well  in  the  folds  of  your  ear 	0.25
and  the  boom  is  quite  secure 	0.25
when  installed  . 	0.0001
I  'd  have  to  imagine 	0.25
it  'd  take  a  big  hit 	0.25
to  knock  it  loose  once  in  place  . 	0.375
Sound  quality  from  the  earbud  is  decent  , 	0.3125
but  I  feel 	0.125
the  Earboom  lacks  some  fidelity  ,  especially  the  higher  frequencies  . 	0.125
Normally  this  is  not  a  problem  , 	0.25
but  it  can  sometimes  make  the  person 	0.0001
you  `  re  talking  to  sound  like  Isaac  Hayes  . 	0.0001
The  speaker  is  plently  loud  and  the  lack  of  high  frequencies  allows  you  to  tune  into  the  tonal  range 	0.175
where  us  humans  tend  to  converse  , 	0.0001
without  having  the  voices 	0.25
washed  over  with  background  noise  . 	0.0001
The  gels  block  an  appropriate  amount  of  external  sounds 	0.0001
allowing  you  to  concentrate  on  the  discussion  at  hand  without  impeding  your  ability 	0.5
to  hear  say 	0.125
an  ambulance  while  driving  . 	0.0001
There  is  a  small  slot  on  the  gels 	0.25
that  funnels  some  external  noise  to  your  drum  , 	0.0001
while  the  rest  of  the  gel  fits  snug  to  the  ear 	0.75
blocking  out  other  stray  noise  paths  . 	0.0001
I  `  ve  asked  people 	0.0001
how  I  sound 	0.0001
and  thus  far  the  feedback  has  been  positive  , 	0.375
my  voice  comes  through  loud  and  clear  despite  the  boom  's  apparent  lack  of  length  , 	0.3333333333333333
reinforcing  my  belief 	0.125
that  size  DOES  N'T  matter  . 	0.125
In  fact  , 	0.0001
I  have  found  the  mic  to  be  very  sensitive  to  even  small  sounds  . 	0.21875
Forget  talking  on  the  phone 	0.0001
and  subtly  typing  on  the  keyboard  our  mouse  click  surfing  - 	0.125
they  `  ll  hear  every  click  . 	0.0001
Another  example  , 	0.0001
I  was  in  my  house 	0.25
and  the  person  on  the  other  end  could  hear  the  kids 	0.0001
playing  in  the  pool  40  feet  away 	0.0001
with  the  house  windows  closed  !  ! 	0.0001
Yes  ,  the  mic  is  that  sensitive  . 	0.25
Even  while  driving  they  could  hear 	0.125
when  I  shifted  gears  . 	0.0001
Not  that  it  's  obtrusive  to  the  other  person  on  the  phone  , 	0.0001
it  's  just  good  to  be  aware 	0.5
they  can  hear  it  all  . 	0.0001
What  more  to  say  about  such  a  simple  device  . 	0.125
Form  Fit  and  Function  are  all  there  and  I  would  recommend  this  product  . 	0.25
In  fact  , 	0.0001
I  just  ordered  another  - 	0.0001
it  makes  a  great  gift 	0.25
I  have  been  using  a  Chemex  10-cup  coffee  maker  for  several  weeks  and  have  never  had  such  good  coffee  before  in  my  life  . 	0.35
I  am  constantly  looking  forward  to  my  next  pot  of  coffee  ! 	0.20833333333333331
There  is  a  downside  to  this  coffee  maker  : 	0.1875
it  is  a  more  manual  procedure  than  what  you  are  used  to  , 	0.25
and  it  also  takes  a  couple  of  pots 	0.0001
to  learn 	0.0001
how  to  use  this  most  efficiently  . 	0.25
The  first  time  I  tried  to  use  mine  , 	0.0001
I  had  ground  my  coffee  way  too  finely  and  it  just  took  forever  ! 	0.1875
The  big  time  consumers  : 	0.25
you  have  to  boil  your  water  separately 	0.25
-LRB-  you  do  have  a  water  kettle  right  ?  -RRB- 	0.25
and  then  you  have  to  gradually  pour  the  boiled  water  through  the  Chemex  . 	0.25
This  means  that  while  the  coffee  is  brewing  , 	0.25
you  are  pouring  ,  or  watching  ,  or  giving  the  filter  area  a  bit  of  a  stir  . 	0.1875
Now  the  up  side  : 	0.0001
you  will  never  ever  ever  drink  a  better  cup  of  coffee  . 	0.875
I  use  filtered  water  ,  freshly  ground  home  roasted  beans  ,  and  this  Chemex  to  produce  the  finest  coffee 	0.0001
I  have  ever  had  the  pleasure  of  drinking  . 	0.25
And  this  coffee  is  a  pleasure  ! 	0.25
In  fact  , 	0.0001
I  `  ve  totally  given  up  using  cream  and  sugar 	0.375
because  my  coffee  no  longer  has  anything  to  hide  . 	0.25
Another  up  side  : 	0.0001
clean  up  means 	0.5
swishing  the  Chemex  with  warm  water 	0.0001
and  tossing  the  water  down  the  drain  . 	0.0001
You  can  also  wash  with  a  bottle  brush 	0.0001
but  this  is  rarely  necessary  . 	0.4375
A  brief  swish  is  really  all 	0.4375
it  takes  to  get  your  Chemex 	0.125
looking  factory  new  . 	0.375
Try  that  with  your  electric  drip  machine  ! 	0.125
Ha  !  That  thing  will  NEVER  look  brand  new  ! 	0.375
Oh  ,  here  's  a  final  upside  : 	0.0001
this  Chemex  brews  the  best  coffee 	0.75
you  `  ll  ever  drink  , 	0.0001
and  it  costs  less  than  just  about  anything  . 	0.0001
You  are  probably  already  spending  more  money  than  this  every  month  at  Starbucks  ! 	0.1875
Go  ahead 	0.0001
and  buy  yourself  one  of  these  . 	0.0001
If  necessary  ,  wake  up  10  minutes  earlier  to  make  your  coffee  . 	0.625
Better  yet  ,  wake  up  20  minutes  earlier  . 	0.375
And 	0.0001
when  your  coffee  is  ready  ,  instead  of  dumping  it  into  a  travel  cup 	0.25
and  bolting  out  the  door  ,  sit  down 	0.0001
and  enjoy  your  first  cup  for  the  next  10  minutes  . 	0.375
You  deserve  it  ! 	0.75
UPDATE  : 	0.0001
It  's  been  a  year  now 	0.25
and  I  still  love  this  Chemex  . 	0.5
However  ,  over  time  the  glass  acquired  a  coffee  color  tinge 	0.125
that  gradually  became  darker  with  each  use  . 	0.0001
Nothing  I  tried  got  it  clean  , 	0.2916666666666667
but  something  my  wife  tried  did  : 	0.0001
a  splash  of  bleach  in  otherwise  clean  water 	0.0001
followed  by  a  thorough  swishing  . 	0.0001
Now  my  Chemex 	0.0001
looks  brand  new 	0.375
My  wife  bought  this  one  from  Best  Buy  without  me  reviewing 	0.375

Amazingly  , 	0.125
I  would  have  bought  it  after  reading  the  reviews  here  . 	0.1875

The  problem  is  they  ca  n't  think  outside  of  the  box  . 	0.25
They  had  me  get  it  repaired 	0.1875

One  day  later  ? 	0.0001
It  breaks  again  . 	0.25

The  rebate  requires  me  to  buy  another  LG  or  Goldstar  product  . 	0.25

that  are  listed  in  the  recipes  to  make  Miso  , 	0.25

You  need  Bonito  flakes  and  kombu  , 	0.25
you  need  things  like  bamboo  leaves  too  . 	0.1875
OK  , 	0.0001
so  you  do  n't  need  bamboo  leaves  , 	0.25
but  having  a  bamboo  plant  around  the  house  would  n't  hurt  . 	0.25
The  book  is  especially  helpful  , 	0.25
