5_cell_pos_1	Well I read through just about every review prior to purchasing this phone
5_cell_pos_2	and was almost thinking twice about it
5_cell_pos_3	after reading some of the reviews here ,
5_cell_pos_4	but I decided to take the plunge
5_cell_pos_5	and go for it .
5_cell_pos_6	Well I 'm glad
5_cell_pos_7	I did .
5_cell_pos_8	All I can say is this phone
5_cell_pos_9	has been a pleasure
5_cell_pos_10	to use from the get-go .
5_cell_pos_11	It has its flaws
5_cell_pos_12	but what phone does n't ?
5_cell_pos_13	The question is whether you ` re going go flip out over an alarm clock or volume strip or is it a trivial issue for you .
5_cell_pos_14	Most of the gripes others have had just seem little to me .
5_cell_pos_15	Let 's talk about the pros and cons :
5_cell_pos_16	Pros :
5_cell_pos_17	1 . Call quality is excellent .
5_cell_pos_18	No static
5_cell_pos_19	what so ever .
5_cell_pos_20	No dropped calls .
5_cell_pos_21	My area has good T-mobile coverage
5_cell_pos_22	so I ca n't complain .
5_cell_pos_23	As a phone
5_cell_pos_24	it does
5_cell_pos_25	what it 's supposed to do .
5_cell_pos_26	Make good quality calls .
5_cell_pos_27	It also pairs with my bluetooth headset
5_cell_pos_28	-LRB- Plantronics 510 -RRB-
5_cell_pos_29	really well .
5_cell_pos_30	Speaker phone is of good quality too .
5_cell_pos_31	2 . Internet works great .
5_cell_pos_32	I have the $ 5.99 plan
5_cell_pos_33	and yes EDGE is n't the fastest
5_cell_pos_34	but it gets the job
5_cell_pos_35	done .
5_cell_pos_36	It does n't matter
5_cell_pos_37	where I 'm at I can check my email ,
5_cell_pos_38	finds restaurants or directions , or just surf the web
5_cell_pos_39	when I 'm bored .
5_cell_pos_40	It really came in handy
5_cell_pos_41	when I was out on vacation
5_cell_pos_42	and lost .
5_cell_pos_43	WiFi works well too .
5_cell_pos_44	Did n't want to fork out the money for hotspots though .
5_cell_pos_45	3 . The camera at 1.3 megapixels is decent quality .
5_cell_pos_46	No it 's not going to replace my regular camera
5_cell_pos_47	but I found it really handy
5_cell_pos_48	when I forgot to take my camera to my friend 's wedding ,
5_cell_pos_49	but was still able to take quality pictures .
5_cell_pos_50	I have n't tried videos yet though .
5_cell_pos_51	4 .
5_cell_pos_52	Mp3\/Video player :
5_cell_pos_53	Now the speakers on this phone are n't the greatest so I would n't use them for listening to music
5_cell_pos_54	but when plugged into a headset
5_cell_pos_55	it sounds pretty good .
5_cell_pos_56	I bought
5_cell_pos_57	a 2GB microSD card bought here at Amazon
5_cell_pos_58	and now I can hold a ton music and movies .
5_cell_pos_59	Videos looks pretty nice
5_cell_pos_60	I 'd have to admit .
5_cell_pos_61	This thing is my travelinig entertainment center .
5_cell_pos_62	I even found a way to play original nintendo games on this thing
5_cell_pos_63	and have been trying Mike Tyson 's Punchout like back in the old days .
5_cell_pos_64	5 . Calendar\/schedule :
5_cell_pos_65	I had a PDA
5_cell_pos_66	but for some reason
5_cell_pos_67	I 'm more compelled to actually use my calendar
5_cell_pos_68	and keep my schedule on this thing
5_cell_pos_69	than I did with my Pocket PC .
5_cell_pos_70	Probably because of convenience reasons .
5_cell_pos_71	6 . Smartphone applications :
5_cell_pos_72	I 'm in the medical field
5_cell_pos_73	and I keep all my medical applications on this phone .
5_cell_pos_74	I can quickly look up drug references or research diseases .
5_cell_pos_75	I really thought I 'd need a touchscreen
5_cell_pos_76	in order to better navigate these programs
5_cell_pos_77	and while it might be slightly easier with a stylus ,
5_cell_pos_78	I do n't find that it 's all that
5_cell_pos_79	necessary
5_cell_pos_80	and still navigate pretty well .
5_cell_pos_81	I just wish the processor were slightly faster for some of these apps ,
5_cell_pos_82	but it 's more than adequate .
5_cell_pos_83	And I 'm not sure
5_cell_pos_84	why people do n't think
5_cell_pos_85	there are a lot of programs for the smartphone .
5_cell_pos_86	Programs written for WM5 are compatable with PPC as well as smartphones equally .
5_cell_pos_87	-LRB- . . . -RRB- .
5_cell_pos_88	7 . Appearance :
5_cell_pos_89	Everyone who sees this phone absolutely loves its looks
5_cell_pos_90	and so do I .
5_cell_pos_91	It looks great
5_cell_pos_92	and feels great .
5_cell_pos_93	I saw this side by side with the Motorola Q
5_cell_pos_94	and the Q just looked so much bulkier and . . . well . . . not
5_cell_pos_95	as nice .
5_cell_pos_96	The rubber backing feels awesome .
5_cell_pos_97	8 .
5_cell_pos_98	Battery :
5_cell_pos_99	For all
5_cell_pos_100	that I use this phone
5_cell_pos_101	for it makes it through the day with plenty battery to spare
5_cell_pos_102	which is all
5_cell_pos_103	I can really ask for .
5_cell_pos_104	I would n't go 2 days without charging the battery though .
5_cell_pos_105	You should charge it every night .
5_cell_pos_106	Cons :
5_cell_pos_107	1 .
5_cell_pos_108	Windows Mobile 5 :
5_cell_pos_109	Mighty Microsoft needs to write a cleaner program .
5_cell_pos_110	However Windows Mobile 6 is on the way
5_cell_pos_111	and will be free to download for T-Mobile customer soon
5_cell_pos_112	so hopefully that ` ll take care of some of the problems .
5_cell_pos_113	I swear just to turn on the bluetooth
5_cell_pos_114	and pair up my bluetooth device
5_cell_pos_115	takes me a whole minute just because of how hard it is to navigate WM5 .
5_cell_pos_116	2 .
5_cell_pos_117	Volume strip :
5_cell_pos_118	Yeah like everyone says
5_cell_pos_119	it sucks .
5_cell_pos_120	I disabled mine .
5_cell_pos_121	Adjusting the volume with this thing is tedious at best .
5_cell_pos_122	Luckily my music\/video programs as well as my stereo headset allow
5_cell_pos_123	me easier ways to adjust the volume
5_cell_pos_124	so it 's not such an issue for me .
5_cell_pos_125	3 . Alarm clock :
5_cell_pos_126	Now I do n't use this all that much
5_cell_pos_127	but I see what everyone says
5_cell_pos_128	about it
5_cell_pos_129	and yeah it 's a pretty idiotic written program .
5_cell_pos_130	However rather than writing half a page on how bad it is I downloaded a free one from the internet
5_cell_pos_131	that works great
5_cell_pos_132	so my life now goes on .
5_cell_pos_133	Summary :
5_cell_pos_134	So I use this device to make quality phone calls , surf the web , check email , play games , listen to music , watch movies , monitor my schedule , check my medical references ,
5_cell_pos_135	and take decent quality pictures .
5_cell_pos_136	All this thing needs
5_cell_pos_137	now is a laser beam
5_cell_pos_138	that will cut through metal
5_cell_pos_139	and it 'd be the greatest gadget
5_cell_pos_140	known to man
