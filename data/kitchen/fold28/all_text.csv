8_kitchen_neg_1	One might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming-flip-mopping is progressive in some way ,
8_kitchen_neg_2	but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier .
8_kitchen_neg_3	Especially
8_kitchen_neg_4	when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup .
8_kitchen_neg_5	I 'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum , and then follow with a functional , well-designed good mop
8_kitchen_neg_6	-LRB- like the old SteamMop they
8_kitchen_neg_7	discontinued -RRB- .
8_kitchen_neg_8	These things function better as seperate units ,
8_kitchen_neg_9	which is why there 's no washing machine
8_kitchen_neg_10	that 's also a dryer .
8_kitchen_neg_11	The Flip-It is a very loud machine -- so loud ,
8_kitchen_neg_12	that I did n't hear my phone ring in the same room .
8_kitchen_neg_13	This makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children , too .
8_kitchen_neg_14	It 's difficult to push and feels like it 's gripping to the floor .
8_kitchen_neg_15	It does n't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs\/cabinets with it 's big fat part-vacuum head .
8_kitchen_neg_16	And ,
8_kitchen_neg_17	when you ` re finished ,
8_kitchen_neg_18	it 's a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter
8_kitchen_neg_19	-LRB-
8_kitchen_neg_20	which you ` re supposed to keep dry somehow -RRB-
8_kitchen_neg_21	so you can look forward to a second job
8_kitchen_neg_22	once you ` ve finished the job of cleaning your floors .
8_kitchen_neg_23	And ,
8_kitchen_neg_24	"because of the "" flip it "" back and forth design ,"
8_kitchen_neg_25	the thing has no equilibrium . . .
8_kitchen_neg_26	it fell to the floor at least 3 times ,
8_kitchen_neg_27	even when I was so careful to rest it against something . . .
8_kitchen_neg_28	"once when this happened , the "" dirty water "" recovery tank hit the floor , fell off the machine"
8_kitchen_neg_29	and spilled the dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor .
8_kitchen_neg_30	A true nightmare .
8_kitchen_neg_31	I bought this product
8_kitchen_neg_32	because I could no longer buy replacement filters\/pads for my Bissell SteamMop , and I thought
8_kitchen_neg_33	I had better give the latest and greatest a try ,
8_kitchen_neg_34	but , sadly , I was disappointed .
8_kitchen_neg_35	I do n't review things often ,
8_kitchen_neg_36	but I felt a responsibility to warn others out there
8_kitchen_neg_37	who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean .
8_kitchen_neg_38	This contraption is not your answer .
8_kitchen_neg_39	On a side note ,
8_kitchen_neg_40	I wrote
8_kitchen_neg_41	to Bissell to bring back the SteamMop
8_kitchen_neg_42	-LRB- what an excellent product -RRB- ,
8_kitchen_neg_43	so I 'm hoping
8_kitchen_neg_44	that they will one day
