positive	0.5625	0.125	that  did  NOT  happen  ;  however  , 
negative	0.625	0.125	I  received  the  Pearl  with  a  SIM  card  that  the  phone  would  not  accept  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	The  instructions

negative	0.125	0.25	that  all  you  have  to  do  is  insert  the  SIM  ,  turn  on  the  phone  ,

negative	0.375	0.25	I  immediately  called  Cingular  , 
negative	0.625	0.0001	and  they  resolved  the  problem  for  me  on  the  spot 
negative	0.375	0.25	-LRB-  SIM  was  not  activated  \/  in  the  system  -RRB- 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  bought  this  phone  as  part  of  the  Sprint\/Nextel  SERO  plan  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  used  it  for  about  14  days  before  deciding 
negative	0.125	0.4375	that  it  did  n't  fit  my  needs  for  several  reasons 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	outlined  below  : 
negative	0.375	0.25	-  Battery  life  was  sporadic  -- 
negative	0.0001	0.125	I  got  maybe  a  day  worth  of  power  from  it  . 
negative	0.0001	0.5	One  time  it  completely 
negative	0.0001	0.125	discharged  overnight  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	For  the  price  of  the  phone 
negative	0.0001	0.25	-LRB-  and  the  two  year  contract  it  carries  -RRB- 
negative	0.125	0.25	this  is  a  dealbreaker  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	-  The  Nextel  network  coverage  has  gone  downhill  in  my  area 
negative	0.125	0.1875	-LRB-  I  was  a  former  Nextel  subscriber  for  3  years 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	- 
negative	0.0001	0.25	so  I  have  some  experience  with  coverage  around  town  -RRB-  . 
negative	0.1875	0.1875	I  was  getting  disconnects 
negative	0.625	0.0001	and  sporadic  no  signals  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	-  The  phone  would  sporadically  mute  the  ringer  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	An  incoming  call  would  light  up  the  display 
negative	0.1875	0.3125	but  there  would  be  no  ringing  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	This  seems 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  happen 
negative	0.0001	0.25	after  I  had  put  the  phone  on  vibrate 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  then  turned  it  back 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  ring  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	-  For  the  same  monthly  service  fee  , 
negative	0.2916666666666667	0.25	I  was  getting  less  access  to  web  services  and  no  high  speed  Internet  ability  . 
negative	0.3333333333333333	0.1875	Admittedly  the  high  speed  access  is  not  as  useful  on  a  tiny  screen  -- 
negative	0.125	0.25	but  if  I  'm  going  to  be  locked  into  a  2  year  contract 
negative	0.0001	0.1875	I  would  like  to  have  some  fast  internet  access  on  the  phone  . 
negative	0.125	0.0001	The  i880  still  uses  the  slow  Nextel  data  network  . 
positive	0.3333333333333333	0.25	I  was  not  a  Direct  Connect\/Walkie  Talkie  user  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	If  I  were  , 
positive	0.34375	0.1875	then  my  opinion  of  this  phone  might  be  a  little  higher 
positive	0.125	0.5	-LRB-  since  Nextel  presently  has  arguably  the  best  fully  functioning  walkie  talkie  network  -RRB-  . 
negative	0.375	0.25	I  could  not  justify  being  locked  into  a  2  year  contract  with  equipment 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	that  seemed  sub-par  on  a  network 
negative	0.625	0.0001	that  did  not 
negative	0.3333333333333333	0.2916666666666667	-LRB-  and  likely  never  will  -RRB-  support  the  latest  high  speed  technologies  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	Below  were  my  initial  impressions  during  the  time  I  used  the  phone  : 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Thankfully  Motorola  designed  the  phone 
positive	0.125	0.4375	so  the  micro-SD  card  is  accessible  from  the  outside  -- 
positive	0.125	0.125	no  need  to  pull  the  battery 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	to  update  the  card  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	Here  's  the  big  things 
negative	0.0001	0.125	I  do  n't  like  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	1  . 
negative	0.625	0.0001	You  CAN  NOT  use  any  mp3  songs 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	that  you  transfer  to  the  micro-sd  card  as  ringtones  . 
negative	0.625	0.0001	2  .  You  also  can  not  readily  load  additional  wallpapers 
negative	0.125	0.25	unless  it  is  a  picture 
negative	0.0001	0.375	you  took  with  the  phone  or  a  paid  download  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Any  message 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB-  mms  -RRB- 
negative	0.375	0.25	that  you  send  to  yourself  can  only  be  set  as  a  caller  id  image  and  not  wallpaper  . 
negative	0.125	0.1875	3  .  Battery  life  on  my  phone  is  flaky  - 
negative	0.0001	0.125	I  'm  getting  maybe  a  day  and  one-half  with  usage 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	that  approximates  60  minutes  talk  time  and  perhaps  6  to  10  picture  messages  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	You  must  pay  Nextel  to  download  ringtones  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	There  are  some  users 
negative	0.375	0.25	who  have  modified  the  phone 
negative	0.25	0.1875	and  reportedly  are  able  to  use  ringtones  off  their  micro-SD  memory  card  -  however  the  process  is  more  technical  than  what  your  average  user  might  want  to  tangle  with  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Note  : 
positive	0.125	0.25	Sprint  and  Nextel  are  both  owned  by  the  same  company  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	If  you  `  re  making  a  decision  on  Sprint  vs  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Nextel  , 
positive	0.125	0.25	there  are  only  a  couple  reasons 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	that  I  can  think  of 
positive	0.125	0.0001	to  recommend  Nextel  over  Sprint  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	First  , 
positive	0.125	0.5625	if  the  Nextel  coverage  is  better  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Second  , 
positive	0.125	0.1875	if  you  have  a  need 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	to  use  the  Nextel  Walkie  Talkie  feature  . 
negative	0.25	0.1875	The  Sprint  side  of  the  company  features  phones  with  significantly  enhanced  web  browsing  and  higher  speed  data  communications  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	The  Nextel  side  clings  to  the  larger  phones 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  aims  their  services  at  the  industrial\/construction  market  . 
negative	0.125	0.5625	For  almost  every  consumer  ,  the  Sprint  side  is  a  better  deal  . 
negative	0.0001	0.5625	Sprint  in  my  experience  has  better  customer  service 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	whereas  Nextel  tends  to  transfer  you  endlessly  among  a  variety  of  customer  service  representatives  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Here  's  my  summary  of  this  phone 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	after  using  it  about  two  weeks  : 
positive	0.0001	0.5	The  Good  : 
positive	0.0001	0.75	-  beautiful  speaker  phone 
positive	0.0001	0.125	-  compact  design  \/  solid  feel 
positive	0.125	0.5	-2  megapixel  camera  ,  ability  to  capture  movies 
positive	0.375	0.0001	-  flip  swings  open 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	when  you  push  a  button 
positive	0.125	0.25	-  Nextel  sms\/mms  messages  can  now  be  auto-downloaded  - 
positive	0.0001	0.125	I  believe 
positive	0.1875	0.3125	this  is  the  first  Nextel  phone  to  sport  this  feature 
positive	0.0001	0.875	-  nice  loud  audio 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	-  both  Nextel  walkie  talkie  and  DirecTalk  support 
negative	0.875	0.0001	The  Bad  : 
negative	0.625	0.0001	-  ca  n't  play  ringtones  off  Micro  SD  or  via  any  other  non-Nextel  transfer 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB-  Note  : 
negative	0.125	0.25	Technically  some  people  have  been  using 
negative	0.0001	0.25	a  Motorola  product  called  webjal  to  make  transfers  with  a  cable  - 
negative	0.125	0.1875	but  this  may  be  more  technical 
negative	0.0001	0.125	than  the  average  user  would  like  to  tackle  -RRB- 
negative	0.225	0.34375	-  Nextel  is  in  my  opinion  on  their  way  out  as  a  carrier  ,  soon  to  be  completely  assimilated  into  the  Sprint  side  of  things  . 
negative	0.625	0.5	While  not  entirely  unexpected  , 
negative	0.375	0.5625	it  means  that  Nextel  plans  and  features  are  not  as  attractive  to  non-construction  users 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB-  Nextel  's  core  group  -RRB-  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	If  you  want  Mobile  to  Mobile  unlimited  minutes 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	you  pay  more  versus  most  Sprint  plans 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	which  include  them  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	Nextel  does  n't  have  the  super  fast  data  speeds  or  network  web  browsing  of  competing  carriers  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	Most  web  browsing  on  Nextel  is  limited  to  character 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	based  wap  sites 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	that  both  crawl  along  speedwise  and  present  unexciting  character 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	based  screens  . 
negative	0.20833333333333331	0.25	-  the  phone  is  a  little  bigger 
negative	0.0001	0.25	that  what  some  have  grown  accustomed  to  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	- 
negative	0.375	0.25	while  not  phone  related  ,  some  users  in  larger  cities  have  reported 
negative	0.125	0.25	the  iDen  system  is  nearing  capactity  with  a  lot  of  busy  signals  . 
negative	0.125	0.1875	-  I  am  only  getting  about  a  day  of  battery  life  - 
negative	0.1875	0.4375	which  is  extremely  low  . 
positive	0.0001	0.5	I  `  ve  lusted  after  a  Super  Auto  for  years  . 
positive	0.0001	0.125	When  I  finally  decided  to  get  one  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  did  a  fare  amount  of  investigating  . 
positive	0.0001	0.46875	The  Gaggia  Titanium  had  the  best  spec  's  for  the  price  and  good  reviews  . 
positive	0.0001	0.125	I  decided  to  spend  the  extra  money  for  the  Stainless  unit  . 
positive	0.0001	0.25	I  have  n't  seen  the  painted  plastic  model 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	so  I  ca  n't  comment  on  the  appearance  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  do  think 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	the  Stainless  looks  great  ! 
positive	0.375	0.16666666666666666	You  can  find  reviews  of  the  non-stainless  here  on  Amazon  and  other  than  the  outside  appearance  ,  the  device  is  the  same  . 
positive	0.0001	0.25	I  `  ve  only  had  the  unit  for  a  few  days 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	but  so  far  , 
positive	0.25	0.5625	I  'm  very  happy  . 
negative	0.25	0.0001	To  the  negatives  first  . 
negative	0.5	0.25	The  manual  is  awful  ! 
negative	0.625	0.0001	It  's  not  just  the  Italian  to  English  translation  ! 
negative	0.375	0.1875	The  text  is  skimpy  and  the  illustrations  not  so  great  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	I  spent 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	a  fair  amount  of  time  making  sure 
negative	0.0001	0.375	I  understood 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	how  to  setup  and  use  the  unit  . 
positive	0.25	0.125	I  'm  pretty  technically  savvy  and  in  the  end  , 
positive	0.0001	0.5	I  figured  it  all  out  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	But  do  n't  rush  into  using  this  product 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	until  you  `  ve  figured  out 
negative	0.375	0.5	how  to  set  it  up  ,  clean  it 
negative	0.0001	0.125	and  adjust  all  the  settings 
negative	0.125	0.25	-LRB-  there  are  many  -RRB-  . 
negative	0.125	0.1875	The  only  issue  I  `  ve  had  is  whereby  the  auto  bean  grinder  thinks 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	it  's  empty 
negative	0.625	0.0001	when  it  's  not  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Open  the  lid 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB- 
negative	0.125	0.375	which  could  be  a  bit  better  designed  -RRB- 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  stir  and 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	it  works  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	Could  be  the  beans 
positive	0.5625	0.25	I  'm  using  not  sure  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	It  's  an  intermittent  issue  . 
positive	0.0001	0.75	The  good  stuff  : 
positive	0.5	0.375	once  you  figure  out  the  coffee  strength  and  grind  ,  the  Gaggia  makes  a  delicious  cup  . 
negative	0.375	0.125	I  wish 
negative	0.125	0.25	the  brew  were  a  tad  hotter 
negative	0.0001	0.25	-LRB-  I  have  it  set  to  max  -RRB- 
positive	0.0001	0.5	but  using  the  cup  warmer  helps  . 
positive	0.0001	0.125	No  issues  making  froth  with  the  wand  ; 
positive	0.0001	0.5	much  better  than  the  older  manual  machine 
positive	0.0001	0.25	I  had  . 
negative	0.25	0.0001	You  ca  n't  put  a  huge  mug  under  the  unit 
negative	0.25	0.1875	-LRB-  the  max  size  is  4.5  inches  -RRB- 
positive	0.4375	0.5	but  its  so  easy  to  make  a  cup  you  just  make  fresh 
positive	0.25	0.25	when  needed  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	You  can  set  the  unit  for  the  amount  of  brew  . 
positive	0.5	0.125	However  , 
positive	0.125	0.25	"I  found  that  clicking  the  ""  large  coffee  ""  button  twice  ,  the  unit  thinks "
positive	0.0001	0.0001	it  's  making  2  cups 
positive	0.3333333333333333	0.125	and  that  just  about  fills  a  decent  size  mug  . 
positive	0.375	0.3125	It  's  much  stronger  too  since  the  unit  grinds  two  doses  of  coffee  instead  of  just  adding  more  hot  water 
positive	0.375	0.125	using  the  programmable  size  . 
positive	0.0001	0.5	You  get  a  nice  foam  on  top 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  as  I  said  , 
positive	0.125	0.25	the  coffee  is  outstanding  . 
positive	0.375	0.5	I  love  the  clean  up 
positive	0.125	0.125	-LRB-  or  lack  of  -RRB- 
positive	0.25	0.25	compared  to  the  drip  maker  I  had  -LRB-  a  Bodum  Vacuum  unit  -RRB-  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	I  still  have  that  unit 
positive	0.25	0.25	should  I  need  to  make  a  lot  of  coffee  for  company  . 
positive	0.25	0.0001	But  for  the  two  mugs 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  drink  in  the  morning  , 
positive	0.5	0.25	the  Gaggia  easily  replaces  this  unit  . 
positive	0.5	0.0001	And  there  's  far  less  cleanup  . 
positive	0.5	0.0001	The  grinds  sit  in  a  canister 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  after  a  few  days  , 
positive	0.125	0.0001	you  just  tap  it  out  into  the  trash 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  maybe  rinse  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	So  ,

negative	0.0001	0.0001	Within  3  weeks  the  teflon  in  the  Zoji  pan  formed  two  blisters  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	One  is  bit

negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  do  n't  let  it  soak  at  all  . 
negative	0.1875	0.25	This  is  clearly  a  manufacturing  defect  . 
negative	0.3125	0.25	I  have  further  complaints  with  respect  to  this  machine  as  compared  to  the  Breadman  Ultimate  : 
negative	0.125	0.125	1  -RRB-  The  top  of  the  bread  rarely  gets  brown  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  `  ve  added  more  sugar  to  the  recipe 
negative	0.0001	0.5	which  helps  slightly 
negative	0.625	0.0001	but  not  much  . 
negative	0.25	0.375	2  -RRB-  I  do  n't  understand  what  the  crust  control  option  does  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	It  does  n't  seem  to  increase  baking  time 
negative	0.0001	0.375	which  it  does  on  the  Breadman  so  it  does  n't  make  much  sense  . 
negative	0.2916666666666667	0.20833333333333331	3  -RRB-  The  programmability  is  very  weak  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	On  the  Breadman 
negative	0.3125	0.375	you  can  take  any  of  the  existing  standard  options 
negative	0.0001	0.4375	and  modify  them  as  well  as  make  up  entirely  new  programs  . 
negative	0.20833333333333331	0.25	4  -RRB-  The  programmability  options  are  very  limited  : 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	-  You  ca  n't  control  the  knockdown  time  between  risings  . 
negative	0.25	0.125	-  You  ca  n't  add  risings  to  the  default  three  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	They  do  give  you  a  lot  of  time  control  on  the  risings  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	-  You  ca  n't  separate  the  mixing  cycle  from  the  kneading  cycle  : 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	it  's  all  one  cycle  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	- 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	When  you  turn  off  the  preheat  cycle  , 
negative	0.375	0.25	this  only  affects  the  built-in  programs  and  not  the  custom  ones  . 
negative	0.75	0.25	-  And  worst  of  all  : 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	you 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	ca  n't  bake  for  more  than  70  minutes  .

negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  so  forth  . 
negative	0.375	0.25	This  is  almost  a  killer  limitation  in  my  opinion  .

positive	0.125	0.125	it  should  work  okay  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	This  means  you  must  use  rapid  rise  yeast  with  the  Quick  programs 
negative	0.4375	0.375	and  active  dry  yeast  with  the  longer  standard  programs  . 
negative	0.5	0.1875	Even  using  Fleischmann  's  instead  of  Red  Star  made  a  difference  . 
negative	0.1875	0.16666666666666666	The  Breadman  was  pretty  much  indifferent  to  yeast  variations  .

negative	0.625	0.25	Please  also  note  that  c139  does  not  have  any  kind  of  interface  as  to  a  pc  so  that  means 
negative	0.125	0.25	you  are  stuck  with  the  bundled  ringtones  and  the  wallpaper  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	IMO  ,  Motorola  could  have  added  a  port

negative	0.375	0.20833333333333331	It  was  short-sighted  and  just  dumb  not  to  considering  the  V120c  -  also  in  the  same  price  range  -  has  such  a  port  .

positive	0.125	0.375	it  is  an  entirely  new  network  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	In  Southern  California  ,  the  network  this  model  TracFone  uses  is  Cingular  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Suffice  it  to  say  ,

negative	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	Also  ,  I  was  n't  overly  impressed  with  the  keypad 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	where  it  concerns  text  messaging  . 
negative	0.125	0.3125	The  V120c  is  actually  more  intuitive  . 
negative	0.25	0.625	It  's  much  easier  to  use  . 
positive	0.0001	0.4375	But  the  c139  does  have  one  advantage  in  this  regard  - 
positive	0.125	0.25	text  messages  cost  only  0.3  units  versus  on  the  V120c  ,  TracFone  was  deducting  0.5  units  for  each  incoming  and  outgoing  text  message  . 
positive	0.5625	0.25	I  'm  not  sure 
positive	0.1875	0.21875	why  that  is  considering  the  deduction  of  units  has  zip  to  do  with  the  model  of  the  phone  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	It  should  be  one  uniform  deduction  across  the  board  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Consumers  should  contact  TracFone  customer  service 
positive	0.0001	0.125	and  inquire  about  this  phenomenon  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	Bottom  line  is  that  I  would  recommend  this  phone  to  anyone 
positive	0.125	0.375	who  is  upgrading  from  a  monochromatic  LED  phone 
positive	0.25	0.375	and  wants  an  \*  inexpensive  \*  phone  with  a  much  easier  on  the  eyes  color  display  .

positive	0.25	0.4166666666666667	Cast  iron  is  a  highly  efficient  material
