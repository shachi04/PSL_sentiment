12_gourmet_neg_1	The description for this item is not accurate .
12_gourmet_neg_2	I bought
12_gourmet_neg_3	the freeze deied raspberries and stawberries from this same company and they are great .
12_gourmet_neg_4	However , these are dehydrated
12_gourmet_neg_5	which means 2 important things :
12_gourmet_neg_6	- Texture :
12_gourmet_neg_7	these are very hard and do not soften if left in milk or water .
12_gourmet_neg_8	Do n't think about adding these to cereal , only for trail mix or eating out of hand .
12_gourmet_neg_9	- Saturated fat :
12_gourmet_neg_10	the second ingredient is coconut oil !
12_gourmet_neg_11	One 2oz .
12_gourmet_neg_12	serving has 190 calories , 19 grams of fat
12_gourmet_neg_13	and 16 grams of saturated fat .
12_gourmet_neg_14	You ` re better off eating Cheetos .
12_gourmet_neg_15	These are extremely unhealthy and do n't even taste that great .
12_gourmet_neg_16	There is -LRB- unsurprisingly -RRB-
12_gourmet_neg_17	and oily aftertaste .
12_gourmet_neg_18	Buyer beware .
12_gourmet_neg_19	Stick to purely freeze dried fruits
12_gourmet_neg_20	- nothing is added
12_gourmet_neg_21	and they are healthy
