6_cell_neg_1	This  review  is  more  about  Virgin  Mobil  customer  service  than  the  phone  . 
6_cell_neg_2	I  ordered  a  VOX  8610  on  1/22/2007  online  thru  Virgin  Mobile  . 
6_cell_neg_3	The  phone  would  n't  charge  . 
6_cell_neg_4	I  called  customer  service 
6_cell_neg_5	and  explained  the  problem  . 
6_cell_neg_6	They  said 
6_cell_neg_7	did 
6_cell_neg_8	I  want  a  charger  or  another  phone  . 
6_cell_neg_9	I  replied  that  I  could  not  tell  if  it  was  the  charger  or  the  phone 
6_cell_neg_10	that  was  at  fault  so  please  send  a  new  kit  . 
6_cell_neg_11	I  received  a  phone 
6_cell_neg_12	but  not  a  charger 
6_cell_neg_13	and  it  also  would  n't  charge  . 
6_cell_neg_14	I  called  customer  service 
6_cell_neg_15	and  explained 
6_cell_neg_16	the  issue 
6_cell_neg_17	and 
6_cell_neg_18	it  must  be  the  charger  at  fault  . 
6_cell_neg_19	The  rep  said 
6_cell_neg_20	they  would  not  send  a  new  charger  , 
6_cell_neg_21	that  I  would  have  to  purchase  one  . 
6_cell_neg_22	I  said 
6_cell_neg_23	this  did  n't  make  any  sense  , 
6_cell_neg_24	according  to  the  offer 
6_cell_neg_25	I  could  return  the  phone  for  a  full  refund 
6_cell_neg_26	and  does  that  mean 
6_cell_neg_27	that  to  get  a  new  phone 
6_cell_neg_28	and  charge  I  need 
6_cell_neg_29	to  return  the  phones  for  a  refund 
6_cell_neg_30	and  then  order  another  one  to  get  a  charger  ? 
6_cell_neg_31	The  support  rep  said 
6_cell_neg_32	yes  and  that  I  had  to  make  up  my  mind  -  either  return  the  phone  or  purchase  a  charger  . 
6_cell_neg_33	I  asked  to  speak  to  a  supervisor  . 
6_cell_neg_34	The  customer  support  rep  kept 
6_cell_neg_35	going  off  line 
6_cell_neg_36	-LRB-  to  talk  to  someone  ?  -RRB- 
6_cell_neg_37	but  refused  or  could  n't  get  a  supervisor 
6_cell_neg_38	to  talk  to  me  . 
6_cell_neg_39	She  then  asked  for  the  ESN  number  of  the  phone  . 
6_cell_neg_40	When  I  said 
6_cell_neg_41	I  did  n't  know 
6_cell_neg_42	what  an  '  ESN  '  number  she  indignantly  explained 
6_cell_neg_43	that  it  was  like  a  serial  number  on  the  back  of  the  phone  . 
6_cell_neg_44	I  'm  not  clear 
6_cell_neg_45	why  she  needed  this  , 
6_cell_neg_46	since  I  have  n't  activated  the  phone 
6_cell_neg_47	and  I  already  referenced  the  order 
6_cell_neg_48	-LRB-  vmu  -RRB-  number  . 
6_cell_neg_49	At  any  rate  I  had  been  on  the  phone  now  for  over  40  min  with  the  support  rep 
6_cell_neg_50	-LRB-  obviously  not  very  cost  effective  for  virgin  mobile  -RRB- 
6_cell_neg_51	and  at  least  she  was  trying  to  track  down  some  info  -  or  so  I  thought  -  she  finally  came  back  on  line 
6_cell_neg_52	and  said 
6_cell_neg_53	that  the  computer  was  down 
6_cell_neg_54	and  she  could  n't  handle  my  order  -  that  I  would  have  to  call  back  . 
6_cell_neg_55	I  called  back  ,  had  to  work  my  way 
6_cell_neg_56	thru  the  answering  system 
6_cell_neg_57	and  got  thru  to  RMA  and  a  fellow 
6_cell_neg_58	named  Mike  . 
6_cell_neg_59	Mike  explained 
6_cell_neg_60	that  they  could  n't  send  a  charger 
6_cell_neg_61	-LRB-  none  in  stock  -RRB- 
6_cell_neg_62	and  that  I  would  have  to  send  the  entire  phone  back  - 
6_cell_neg_63	which  is  what  I  am  now  doing  - 
6_cell_neg_64	60  +  minutes  after  the  initial  call  . 
6_cell_neg_65	I  have  to  say 
6_cell_neg_66	that  my  interactions  with  virgin  mobile  so  far  has  not  been  positive  . 
6_cell_neg_67	They  customer  service  staff  is  obviously  poorly  trained  and  not  empowered  to  make  decisions  . 
6_cell_neg_68	The  interfaces  with  support  are  youth 
6_cell_neg_69	geared  -  not  a  bad  thing  except  when  it  is  at  the  expense  of  treating  adults  courteously  and  professionally  . 
6_cell_neg_70	I  am 
6_cell_neg_71	sending  the  phone  back  for  a  refund 
6_cell_neg_72	and  re-considering  the  provider  for  pay-as-you-go  service  . 
6_cell_neg_73	01/26/2007  . 
14_cell_pos_1	I  got  this  phone  2  weeks  back  although  I  have  seen  this  with  my  cousin  in  Singapore  quite  sometime  back  . 
14_cell_pos_2	Just  right  off  the  box  ,  the  phone  is  quite  impressive  . 
14_cell_pos_3	Many  complain  about  the  response  time  -  yes  ,  this  phone  is  slow 
14_cell_pos_4	but  does  n't  bother  me 
14_cell_pos_5	-  far  better  than  my  windows  machine  Overall  ,  very  good  phone 
14_cell_pos_6	for  what  it  offers  . 
14_cell_pos_7	Pros  : 
14_cell_pos_8	\*  This  phone  tops  in  ergonomics  ,  ease  of  use  ,  presentation  ,  features  ,  Bluetooth  ,  speakerphone  and  call  quality  . 
14_cell_pos_9	\*  Wi-fi  is  worth 
14_cell_pos_10	mentioning  separately  . 
14_cell_pos_11	It  is  simply  superb  . 
14_cell_pos_12	\*  Nokia  's  connection  manager  is  far  superior  than  anyone  else  in  the  market  . 
14_cell_pos_13	It  handles  very 
14_cell_pos_14	efficiently  that  one  can  easily  choose  between  several  access  points 
14_cell_pos_15	and  save  lots  of  money  . 
14_cell_pos_16	I  accidentally 
14_cell_pos_17	downloaded  a  big  chunk  of  data 
14_cell_pos_18	and  going  to  pay  through  my  nose  next  month  ! 
14_cell_pos_19	\*  All  the  apps 
14_cell_pos_20	that 
14_cell_pos_21	come  with  this  phone  are  quite  good  . 
14_cell_pos_22	\*  BT  sync  with  my  apple  is  just  fine  with  iSync  . 
14_cell_pos_23	Also  I  transfer  music\/themes\/ringtones 
14_cell_pos_24	using  data  cable  from  my  Wintel  . 
14_cell_pos_25	"The  phone  automatically  toggles  to  ""  Mass  storage  ""  mode "
14_cell_pos_26	when  it  is  connected  to  PC  , 
14_cell_pos_27	which  is  pretty  neat  . 
14_cell_pos_28	\*  I  have  n't  faced  any  such  problem  as  I  charge  my  gadgets  daily  . 
14_cell_pos_29	I  also  tried  leaving  it  uncharged 
14_cell_pos_30	and  it  comes  for  2-3  days  ,  good  enough  for  my  call  volumes  . 
14_cell_pos_31	\*  Symbian  browser  is  fast  and  stunning  . 
14_cell_pos_32	Bookmarks  feature  is  neat  . 
14_cell_pos_33	Having  the  wi-fi  feature  helps  you  to  set  all  the  bookmarks 
14_cell_pos_34	while  you  `  re  at  home 
14_cell_pos_35	and  then  use  it  wisely 
14_cell_pos_36	while  you  are  away  . 
14_cell_pos_37	\*  Camera  quality  is  good  . 
14_cell_pos_38	Dual  camera  is  just  a  great  idea  . 
14_cell_pos_39	Camera  settings  are  similar  to  professional  cameras  -  very  very  impressive  ! 
14_cell_pos_40	\*  Tried  the  video  mode 
14_cell_pos_41	and  came  fine  . 
14_cell_pos_42	\*  Battery  life  , 
14_cell_pos_43	as  many  claim  , 
14_cell_pos_44	seems  short  - 
14_cell_pos_45	but  I  charge  my  gadgets  daily  -  so  not  a  big  issue 
14_cell_pos_46	\*  The  headset  that  comes  with  the  phone  is  really  good  . 
14_cell_pos_47	\*  Tonnes  of  themes  , 
14_cell_pos_48	apps  etc  available  for  this  phone  .  .  . 
14_cell_pos_49	Cons 
14_cell_pos_50	\*  My  first  biggest  problem  is  that  the  main  navigation  key  is  badly  designed  . 
14_cell_pos_51	It  is  made  of  cheap  plastic  and  almost  8  out  of  10  times 
14_cell_pos_52	"I  ""  selected  "" "
14_cell_pos_53	an  option 
14_cell_pos_54	when  I  was  actually  trying  to  navigate  to  left  . 
14_cell_pos_55	It  is  SO  frustrating  . 
14_cell_pos_56	\*  My  second  biggest  problem  with  this  phone  is 
14_cell_pos_57	when  the  slider  is  on  , 
14_cell_pos_58	the  screen  light  does  not  come  up  . 
14_cell_pos_59	So  you  wo  n't  know  -  even  in  the  day  - 
14_cell_pos_60	"which  button  to  press  to  answer  the  question  ""  Unlock  phone  ?  "" "
14_cell_pos_61	- 
14_cell_pos_62	you  will  get  that 
14_cell_pos_63	by  practice 
14_cell_pos_64	but  it  is  truly  a  pain  . 
14_cell_pos_65	\*  The  process  of  taking  a  picture  sucks  . 
14_cell_pos_66	The  picture  what  you  see  on  the  screen 
14_cell_pos_67	when  you  hear  the  shutter  sound  is  NOT  what  you  get  . 
14_cell_pos_68	There  is  a  serious  lag  between  the  shutter  click  and  the  final  image  . 
14_cell_pos_69	I  sincerely  hope  if  there  would  be  some  s\/w  patch  for  this  . 
14_cell_pos_70	I  am  anyway  not  a  big  fan  of  phone  cameras  -  with  an  exception  of  Sony  Ericsson  W810i  . 
14_cell_pos_71	That  is  one  far  superior  camera  quality 
14_cell_pos_72	I  saw  so  far  . 
14_cell_pos_73	\*  Slider  lock  and  unlock  feature  is  good  and  bad  . 
14_cell_pos_74	I  am 
14_cell_pos_75	putting  this  on  the  bad  section  as  even  if  the  slider  opens  in  your  pocket  , 
14_cell_pos_76	the  phone  could  turn  on 
14_cell_pos_77	and  end  up  with  accidental  redialing  . 
14_cell_pos_78	So  you  would  need  a  small  app 
14_cell_pos_79	to  do  the  locking  properly  . 
14_cell_pos_80	Overall  -  good  phone  . 
14_cell_pos_81	At  this  point  ,  Nokia  has  better  phones  like  N95  etc  -  of  course  very  expensive  . 
6_kitchen_pos_1	Using  a  Chemex  requires  water  to  be  heated  in  a  tea  kettle  prior  to  brewing  , 
6_kitchen_pos_2	and  it  requires  a  finer  ground  than  what  auto-drip  machines  ask  for  . 
6_kitchen_pos_3	After  the  water  is  brought  to  a  boil  , 
6_kitchen_pos_4	it  's  important  to  wait  for  it  to  cool  just  slightly 
6_kitchen_pos_5	-LRB-  about  30  seconds  -RRB- 
6_kitchen_pos_6	and 
6_kitchen_pos_7	then 
6_kitchen_pos_8	you  need 
6_kitchen_pos_9	to  wet  the  grounds  in  the  filter  ,  wait  for  them  to  drain  , 
6_kitchen_pos_10	and  then  fill  the  pot  with  water  . 
6_kitchen_pos_11	Want  more  than  a  single  cup  of  coffee  ? 
6_kitchen_pos_12	You  wait  for  your  first  pour  to  brew  , 
6_kitchen_pos_13	and  then  fill  the  filter  again  . 
6_kitchen_pos_14	Some  advantages  over  other  forms  of  coffee  brewing  : 
6_kitchen_pos_15	1  .  Taste  : 
6_kitchen_pos_16	I  do  n't  know 
6_kitchen_pos_17	how  it  does  it  , 
6_kitchen_pos_18	but  the  filter  does  keep  your  coffee  from  being  bitter  . 
6_kitchen_pos_19	2  .  Cleanability  : 
6_kitchen_pos_20	Users  can  keep  all  necessary  components  clean 
6_kitchen_pos_21	-LRB-  anyone 
6_kitchen_pos_22	who  's  brewed  water  and  vinegar  through  their  coffee  maker  to  kill  off  a  bitter  taste 
6_kitchen_pos_23	that  was  n't  there 
6_kitchen_pos_24	when  you  bought 
6_kitchen_pos_25	it  understands  this  plight  -RRB-  . 
6_kitchen_pos_26	Oftentimes  ,  the  most  aggressive  criticism  of  the  Chemex  is  its  ponderousness 
6_kitchen_pos_27	to  clean 
6_kitchen_pos_28	because  it  's  not  possible  to  get  your  hand  into  the  reservoir  . 
6_kitchen_pos_29	Some  people  prefer 
6_kitchen_pos_30	to  add  hot  water  and  soap  and  give  it  a  good  rinse  , 
6_kitchen_pos_31	which  is  fine  if  you  clean  the  moment 
6_kitchen_pos_32	you  empty  the  pot  , 
6_kitchen_pos_33	but  if  you  `  re  like  me 
6_kitchen_pos_34	and  you  let 
6_kitchen_pos_35	the  remaining  sip  or  two  sit 
6_kitchen_pos_36	until  a  nice  coffee  stain  is  on  the  glass  , 
6_kitchen_pos_37	then  you  need  some  good  '  ol  fashion  friction 
6_kitchen_pos_38	to  get 
6_kitchen_pos_39	it  clean  . 
6_kitchen_pos_40	The  best  thing  I  `  ve  found  : 
6_kitchen_pos_41	a  baby  bottle  cleaner  . 
6_kitchen_pos_42	It  's  narrow  enough 
6_kitchen_pos_43	to  get  into  the  reservoir 
6_kitchen_pos_44	and  the  angle  can  be  adjusted  to  scrap  the  walls  ,  too  . 
6_kitchen_pos_45	Brilliant  ! 
6_kitchen_pos_46	3  .  Electricity  Free  : 
6_kitchen_pos_47	As  long  as  you  can  boil  water  , 
6_kitchen_pos_48	you  can  have  coffee  . 
6_kitchen_pos_49	4  .  Mud\/Sludge  : 
6_kitchen_pos_50	French  press  and  stove-top 
6_kitchen_pos_51	espresso-style  brewing  always  leaves  a  thick  slime  at  the  bottom  of  an  otherwise  rich  cup  of  coffee  . 
6_kitchen_pos_52	Do  n't  get 
6_kitchen_pos_53	me  wrong  : 
6_kitchen_pos_54	I  think 
6_kitchen_pos_55	that  's  good 
6_kitchen_pos_56	-LRB-  I  use  a  French  Press 
6_kitchen_pos_57	when  I  'm  in  the  mood  -RRB-  , 
6_kitchen_pos_58	but  the  cone  on  a  Chemex  does  n't  allow  that  at  all  . 
6_kitchen_pos_59	5  .  Style\/Size  : 
6_kitchen_pos_60	the  Chemex  coffee  pot  is  a  relic 
6_kitchen_pos_61	-LRB-  designed  in  the  40s  -RRB- 
6_kitchen_pos_62	and  the  wood  cuff  with  rawhide  tie  screams  simplicity  and  elegance 
6_kitchen_pos_63	and  it  's  a  wonderful  ,  minimalist  sight  on  any  kitchen  counter 
6_kitchen_pos_64	-LRB-  and  unlike  electric  coffee  makers  ,  easy  to  move  if  you  need  the  space  -RRB-  . 
6_kitchen_pos_65	Some  drawbacks  any  purchaser  should  consider  : 
6_kitchen_pos_66	1  .  Time  : 
6_kitchen_pos_67	it  does  take  5 
6_kitchen_pos_68	- 
6_kitchen_pos_69	10  minutes  of  labor 
6_kitchen_pos_70	to  get  the  morning  cup  of  coffee  . 
6_kitchen_pos_71	2  .  Cones  : 
6_kitchen_pos_72	you  ca  n't  run  over  to  Wal-Mart 
6_kitchen_pos_73	when  you  use  the  last  filter  ; 
6_kitchen_pos_74	you  need 
6_kitchen_pos_75	to  find  a  specialty  store  or  go  online  , 
6_kitchen_pos_76	which  means 
6_kitchen_pos_77	you  need 
6_kitchen_pos_78	to  plan  ahead  . 
6_kitchen_pos_79	3  .  Cold  Coffee  : 
6_kitchen_pos_80	no  electric  hot  plate 
6_kitchen_pos_81	-LRB-  thank  god  -RRB- 
6_kitchen_pos_82	means  coffee  not  poured  and  consumed  immediately  gets  cold  quickly  . 
6_kitchen_pos_83	You  can  buy  a  wire  guard  and  a  glass  lid  so  your  Chemex  can  be  warmed  on  the  stovetop  . 
6_kitchen_pos_84	I  think 
6_kitchen_pos_85	that  's  more  labor 
6_kitchen_pos_86	added  to  an  already  laborious  endeavor  . 
6_kitchen_pos_87	Just  have  a  warmed  thermos  ready 
6_kitchen_pos_88	and  use  that  to  store  any  unused  coffee  . 
6_kitchen_pos_89	4  .  Learning  Curve  : 
6_kitchen_pos_90	It  does  take  some  time  to  get  the  grind  right  ,  the  amount  right 
6_kitchen_pos_91	and  the  water  level  right  to  find  a  cup 
6_kitchen_pos_92	which  caters  to  your  tongue  . 
6_kitchen_pos_93	5  . 
6_kitchen_pos_94	Cleanability  : 
6_kitchen_pos_95	I  know 
6_kitchen_pos_96	this  is  in  the  advantages  column  ,  as  well  , 
6_kitchen_pos_97	but  it  's  worth 
6_kitchen_pos_98	mentioning 
6_kitchen_pos_99	that  a  lot  of  people  hate 
6_kitchen_pos_100	cleaning  these  things  . 
6_kitchen_pos_101	To  submerge  it  does  mean  pulling  off  the  wood  cuff 
6_kitchen_pos_102	-LRB- 
6_kitchen_pos_103	which  is  a  small  pain  -RRB- 
6_kitchen_pos_104	else 
6_kitchen_pos_105	it  will  get  nasty  over  time 
10_kitchen_neg_1	I  am 
10_kitchen_neg_2	looking  for  a  remote  trainer  for  one  of  my  dogs  . 
10_kitchen_neg_3	Amazon  's  listing  says 
10_kitchen_neg_4	"this  Innotek  trainer  comes  with  a  ""  lifetime  warranty  .  "" "
10_kitchen_neg_5	I  `  ve  read 
10_kitchen_neg_6	that  batteries  can  be  an  issue  with  remote  training  collars  ,  so  I  decided  to  review  the  owner  's  manual 
10_kitchen_neg_7	to  learn  more  about  the  warranty  . 
10_kitchen_neg_8	-LRB-  .  .  .  -RRB- 
10_kitchen_neg_9	The  last  page  has  a  section 
10_kitchen_neg_10	"entitled  ""  Lifetime  Limited  Warranty  ,  "" "
10_kitchen_neg_11	"which  states  ""  .  .  .  INNOTEK  brand  products  will  be  free  from  defects  in  material  and  workmanship  ,  under  normal  use  ,  for  a  period  of  one  year  from  the  date  of  the  original  retail  purchase  .  "" "
10_kitchen_neg_12	"The  ""  lifetime  warranty  "" "
10_kitchen_neg_13	apparently  expires  after  one  year  ! 
10_kitchen_neg_14	Further  on  it  says  , 
10_kitchen_neg_15	"the  company  ""  offers  several  product  exchange  options  during  the  warranty  period  .  .  . "
10_kitchen_neg_16	"Costs  are  dependent  on  the  processing  time  .  "" "
10_kitchen_neg_17	"This  suggests  customers  will  incur  fees  for  warranty  repairs  even  during  the  one  year  ""  lifetime  ""  warranty  . "
10_kitchen_neg_18	The  next  paragraph  says 
10_kitchen_neg_19	After  one  year  from  date  of  original  retail  purchase  , 
10_kitchen_neg_20	we  will  repair  ,  replace  or  upgrade  your  product  at  a  fixed  rate 
10_kitchen_neg_21	"based  on  the  component  .  "" "
10_kitchen_neg_22	What  will  these  repairs  cost  ? 
10_kitchen_neg_23	This  leaves  me  with  a  big  question  mark  about  buying  a  collar  from  Innotek  . 
10_kitchen_neg_24	What  ,  if  anything  , 
10_kitchen_neg_25	"is  warranted  for  a  ""  lifetime  ?  "" "
10_kitchen_neg_26	If  the  lifetime  warranty  is  really  only  for  one  year  , 
10_kitchen_neg_27	"why  call  it  ""  lifetime  ?  "" "
10_kitchen_neg_28	"And  finally  ,  what  will  repairs  cost  ,  both  during  warranty  under  their  ""  product  exchange  options  "" "
10_kitchen_neg_29	"and  afterwards  under  their  component-based  ""  fixed  rate  ?  "" "
10_kitchen_neg_30	My  specific  concern  is  that  the  collar  contains  a  rechargeable  battery  . 
10_kitchen_neg_31	The  manual  does  not  indicate  that  this  battery  is  user-replaceable  . 
10_kitchen_neg_32	Does  this  mean  the  user  will  have  to  send  the  collar  to  Innotek  to  replace  the  battery  and  ,  if  so  , 
10_kitchen_neg_33	what  will  it  cost  ? 
10_kitchen_neg_34	I  have  contacted  Innotek  through  their  website 
10_kitchen_neg_35	and  will  report  back  if  I  get  a  response  . 
10_kitchen_neg_36	Until  I  do  , 
10_kitchen_neg_37	I  `  ve  got  to  rate  this  product  with  only  one  star 
10_kitchen_neg_38	because  of  the  warranty  . 
10_kitchen_neg_39	Can  anyone  comment  on  warranty  claims  to  Innotek 
13_gourmet_pos_1	The  Easy  Sprouter  is  a  great  vertical  sprouter  . 
13_gourmet_pos_2	The  seeds  or  beans  go  into  an  inner  cup  with  drainage  holes  . 
13_gourmet_pos_3	The  inner  cup  sets  in  the  outer  cup 
13_gourmet_pos_4	which  catches  any  dripping  water 
13_gourmet_pos_5	and  still  allows  air  circulation  around  the  inner  cup  on  all  sides  . 
13_gourmet_pos_6	Maintaining  your  growing  sprouts 
13_gourmet_pos_7	-LRB-  for  most  seed  types  -RRB- 
13_gourmet_pos_8	means 
13_gourmet_pos_9	holding  the  inner  cup  under  running  water  for  at  least  thirty  seconds  , 
13_gourmet_pos_10	allowing  excess  water 
13_gourmet_pos_11	to  drain  off  , 
13_gourmet_pos_12	and  setting  the  inner  cup  back  in  the  outer  cup  . 
13_gourmet_pos_13	Doing  this  two  or  three  times  a  day  makes  sure 
13_gourmet_pos_14	that  the  growing  sprouts  remain  fresh  enough 
13_gourmet_pos_15	to  avoid  spoiling  , 
13_gourmet_pos_16	moist  enough  not  to  dry  out  , 
13_gourmet_pos_17	but  never  remaining  in  standing  water  . 
13_gourmet_pos_18	Most  seeds  need  to  be  pre-soaked  initially  ,  and  this  step  can  be  managed  directly  in  the  Easy  Sprouter  . 
13_gourmet_pos_19	There  are  three  lids  :  two  lock  into  place  -  one  with  air  holes  ,  one  without  . 
13_gourmet_pos_20	The  third  is  domed  , 
13_gourmet_pos_21	but  does  n't  actually  lock  onto  the  cup  . 
13_gourmet_pos_22	By  comparison  , 
13_gourmet_pos_23	sprouting  in  canning  jars  requires  the  jar  to  be  filled  and  emptied  several  times  with  each  rinsing  , 
13_gourmet_pos_24	and  draining  sufficiently  is  not  always  easy  . 
13_gourmet_pos_25	The  Sprout  Master  , 
13_gourmet_pos_26	which  is  another  sprouting  tray 
13_gourmet_pos_27	I  love  ,  allows  similar  rinsing  , 
13_gourmet_pos_28	but  the  seeds  must  be  soaked  in  a  different  container 
13_gourmet_pos_29	and  then  transfered  to  the  Sprout  Master  . 
13_gourmet_pos_30	The  Sprout  Master  allows  the  growing  plants  slightly  more  light 
13_gourmet_pos_31	because  it  has  width 
13_gourmet_pos_32	rather  than  height  , 
13_gourmet_pos_33	but  the  difference  is  slight  . 
13_gourmet_pos_34	I  `  ve  mostly  used  my  Easy  Sprouter  for  leafy  sprout  salad  mixes 
13_gourmet_pos_35	-LRB-  alfalfa  ,  clover  ,  etc  .  .  .  -RRB- 
13_gourmet_pos_36	These  varieties  take  about  a  week  to  grow  . 
13_gourmet_pos_37	With  the  variety  of  lids  the  sprouter 
13_gourmet_pos_38	it  is  very  flexible  . 
13_gourmet_pos_39	I  have  n't  tried  to  sprout 
13_gourmet_pos_40	while  traveling  , 
13_gourmet_pos_41	but  I  'm  confident 
13_gourmet_pos_42	that  it  would  work  well  . 
13_gourmet_pos_43	It  works  for  storing  your  grown  sprouts  in  the  fridge  as  advertised  , 
13_gourmet_pos_44	but  I  usually  take  them  out  of  the  sprouter 
13_gourmet_pos_45	and  break  up  the  clumps  before  serving  and  put  any  left-overs  into  a  different  container  . 
13_gourmet_pos_46	I  use  my  Easy  Sprouter  nearly  constantly  ,  along  with  my  Sprout  Master  mini  trays  . 
13_gourmet_pos_47	I  currently  have  a  second  Easy  Sprouter  on  order 
7_gourmet_neg_1	Good  black  tea  is  not  hard  to  find  -  just  hard  to  find  in  your  grocery  store  . 
7_gourmet_neg_2	The  honest  truth  is  that  Tazo  really  does  not  make  many  ,  if  any  really  good  teas  . 
7_gourmet_neg_3	This  ,  in  particular  ,  is  one  of  their  worst  . 
7_gourmet_neg_4	It  is  bitter 
7_gourmet_neg_5	and  leaves  a  bad  taste  in  your  mouth  immediately  . 
7_gourmet_neg_6	Every  time  i  get 
7_gourmet_neg_7	stuck  in  a  starbucks  with  friends 
7_gourmet_neg_8	i  am  faced  with  the  choice  -  tea  ,  chai  or  steamed  milk  . 
7_gourmet_neg_9	Every  time  i  cave  in 
7_gourmet_neg_10	and  give  Tazo  another  chance 
7_gourmet_neg_11	it  disappoints  me  . 
7_gourmet_neg_12	If  you  want  a  good  black  tea  look  for  a  local  tea  shop 
7_gourmet_neg_13	and  let  them  brew 
7_gourmet_neg_14	you  a  few  cups  . 
7_gourmet_neg_15	Try  a  keemun  ,  a  lapsang  and  maybe  golden  dianhong 
7_gourmet_neg_16	and  see 
7_gourmet_neg_17	how  it  goes  . 
7_gourmet_neg_18	If  you  really  want  to  kick  it  up  a  notch  look  for  a 
7_gourmet_neg_19	Cameroonian  black  . 
7_gourmet_neg_20	take  it  from  someone 
7_gourmet_neg_21	who  really  loves  tea  ,  this  stuff  is  not  worth  your  time  . 
7_gourmet_neg_22	and  when  you  get  good  tea  , 
7_gourmet_neg_23	please  do  n't  brew  it  in  your  coffee  maker 
10_cell_neg_1	When  I  recieved  this  item  , 
10_cell_neg_2	I  had  mixed  emotions  for  the  product  . 
10_cell_neg_3	On  one  hand  , 
10_cell_neg_4	the  black  finish  looked  very  nice  , 
10_cell_neg_5	and  the  clear  plastic  covering  protected  the  screen 
10_cell_neg_6	but  was  still  easy  to  read  . 
10_cell_neg_7	Also  ,  all  of  the  side  buttons  are  fairly  easy  to  reach  with  average-sized  fingers 
10_cell_neg_8	-LRB-  except  maybe  the  camera  button  -RRB-  , 
10_cell_neg_9	so  navigating  the  phone  with  the  cover  still  closed  is  pretty  easy 
10_cell_neg_10	unless  you  need 
10_cell_neg_11	to  use  touch  functions  or  open  the  QWERTY  keyboard  . 
10_cell_neg_12	However  ,  due  to  the  padding  and  the  nature  of  the  metal  materials  ,  the  case  is  very  thick  and  bulky  - 
10_cell_neg_13	when  using  the  belt  clip  ,  the  phone  sticks  out  far 
10_cell_neg_14	enough  that  it  does  not  even  rest  evenly  on  your  hip  , 
10_cell_neg_15	but  leans  at  an  angle  . 
10_cell_neg_16	BUT  ,  the  deciding  factor  in  my  two-star  rating  is  that  this  case  was  the  cause  of  the  only  two  times  I  have  dropped  my  Cingular  8525  -LRB- 
10_cell_neg_17	which  at  such  a  steep  price  ,  is  not  something 
10_cell_neg_18	I  like  to  drop  -RRB-  . 
10_cell_neg_19	The  problem  lies  with  the  snap-shut  system 
10_cell_neg_20	that  closes  the  case  . 
10_cell_neg_21	Because  the  metal  is  so  thin  , 
10_cell_neg_22	it  does  not  secure  very  well  , 
10_cell_neg_23	and  can  come  open  pretty  easily  . 
10_cell_neg_24	To  fix  this  , 
10_cell_neg_25	I  simply  bent  the  piece  of  metal  downward  and  towards  the  phone  , 
10_cell_neg_26	so  that  it  was  much  harder  to  both  open  and  close  the  case  . 
10_cell_neg_27	This  ,  for  the  most  part  ,  solves  the  problem  , 
10_cell_neg_28	but  it  is  still  dangerous 
10_cell_neg_29	and  caution  is  DEFINATELY  in  order  . 
10_cell_neg_30	My  favorite  thing  about  this  case  is  that  you  can  open  the  case 
10_cell_neg_31	and  slide  the  keyboard  open  without  actually  taking  the  phone  out  of  the  case  . 
10_cell_neg_32	This  is  nice 
10_cell_neg_33	because  it  enable  quick  replies  to  text  messages  . 
10_cell_neg_34	This  is  the  only  reason 
10_cell_neg_35	I  did  not  give  it  a  one-star  rating  . 
10_cell_neg_36	I  am  currently  looking  for  a  soft  case  ,  preferably  a  leather  sleeve  case  that  I  can  just  pull  my  phone  out  of  off  of  my  hip  , 
10_cell_neg_37	rather  than  bother  with  a  clip  anymore  . 
10_cell_neg_38	As  a  final  warning  -  BE 
10_cell_neg_39	CAREFUL  if  you  buy  this  case  . 
10_cell_neg_40	Plus  , 
10_cell_neg_41	I  seriously  do  not  believe 
10_cell_neg_42	it  is  worth  its  steep  price  point 
2_cell_pos_1	I  think  this  is  a  pretty  good  earpiece  .  .  . 
2_cell_pos_2	granted  , 
2_cell_pos_3	I  `  ve  only  used  one  other 
2_cell_pos_4	-LRB-  it  was  a  flimsy  little  thing 
2_cell_pos_5	that  came  w  \/  my  friend  's  Nokia  -RRB-  , 
2_cell_pos_6	but  this  one  far  surpasses  that  one  in  sound  quality  and  comfort  . 
2_cell_pos_7	Where  my  friend  's  would  fall  out  of  my  ear  ,  this  one 
2_cell_pos_8	-LRB-  once  I  got 
2_cell_pos_9	it  figured  out  -RRB- 
2_cell_pos_10	never  comes  loose  . 
2_cell_pos_11	Second  , 
2_cell_pos_12	listening  to  people  on  my  friend  's  , 
2_cell_pos_13	I  would  have  to  turn  up  the  sound  to  hear  the  person  well  , 
2_cell_pos_14	and  then  they  sounded  muffled  and  distorted  ; 
2_cell_pos_15	but  on  my  Jabra 
2_cell_pos_16	I  can  actually  turn  down  the  volume  on  my  phone 
2_cell_pos_17	and  they  sound  crisp  and  clear  --  moreso  than  when  I  'm  not  using  the  earpiece  . 
2_cell_pos_18	Finally  , 
2_cell_pos_19	when  my  friend  calls  me 
2_cell_pos_20	and  uses  her  earpiece  , 
2_cell_pos_21	she  sounds  distant 
2_cell_pos_22	and  muffled  ; 
2_cell_pos_23	I  `  ve  had  no  complaints  from  the  people 
2_cell_pos_24	I  'm  talking  to  using  the  Jabra  , 
2_cell_pos_25	and  , 
2_cell_pos_26	in  fact  , 
2_cell_pos_27	my  mom  said 
2_cell_pos_28	it  sounds  better 
2_cell_pos_29	when  I  use  the  EarBoom  than  when  I  do  n't  . 
2_cell_pos_30	The  ear  gels  are  a  bit  hard  to  get 
2_cell_pos_31	used  to  . 
2_cell_pos_32	They  are  oddly  shaped 
2_cell_pos_33	-LRB- 
2_cell_pos_34	as  you  can  see  in  the  picture  -RRB-  , 
2_cell_pos_35	and  there  are  six  of  them  total  --  three  of  them  for  each  ear  . 
2_cell_pos_36	Lots  of  reviewers  complained  about  the  fit  and  comfort  of  the  ear  gels  , 
2_cell_pos_37	while  others  claim 
2_cell_pos_38	these  are  the  most  comfortable  earpieces 
2_cell_pos_39	they  `  ve  used  and  that  they  fit  perfectly  .  .  . 
2_cell_pos_40	I  can  honesly  say 
2_cell_pos_41	I  `  ve  had  both  experiences  . 
2_cell_pos_42	When  I  first  got  this  unit  the  earpiece  kept  falling  out  everytime 
2_cell_pos_43	that  I  would  turn  my  head  : 
2_cell_pos_44	\*  very  \*  frustrating  . 
2_cell_pos_45	I  tried 
2_cell_pos_46	pushing  it  into  my  ear  as  hard  as  I  could  , 
2_cell_pos_47	I  tried 
2_cell_pos_48	holding  it  in  place  with  my  hand  ,  but  that  only  seemed  to  defeat  the  purpose  of  having  a  hands-free  earpiece  . 
2_cell_pos_49	Nothing  seemed  to  work  . 
2_cell_pos_50	I  was  thinking  of  returning  it  . 
2_cell_pos_51	I  was  thinking  of  throwing  it  into  traffic  on  I-95  . 
2_cell_pos_52	And  then  one  day  ,  somehow  ,  I  came  to  the  realization  that  you  have  to  sort  of  twist  it  into  your  ear  --  with  the  little  poky-out  part  stuck  in  the  fold  of  your  ear  next  to  the  ear  canal 
2_cell_pos_53	-LRB-  not  the  fold  on  the  top  of  your  ear  ; 
2_cell_pos_54	if  you  do 
2_cell_pos_55	that  it  `  ll  just  pop  out  again  -RRB-  -- 
2_cell_pos_56	and  then  \*  voila  \*  it  stays  put  . 
2_cell_pos_57	Matter  o  '  fact  , 
2_cell_pos_58	it  `  ll  stay  put  so  well  that  it  `  ll  be  a  little  bit  difficult 
2_cell_pos_59	--  even  \*  painful  \*  -- 
2_cell_pos_60	to  get  out  again  . 
2_cell_pos_61	I  can  imagine  that  people  with  different  ear  sizes  ,  different  patience  levels  ,  and  lower  IQs  might  have  different  experiences  than  my  own  . 
2_cell_pos_62	But  all  I  can  say  is  that  once  I  had  this  little  bugger 
2_cell_pos_63	figured  out  , 
2_cell_pos_64	I  was  golden  . 
2_cell_pos_65	I  love  this  thing 
2_cell_pos_66	and  almost  never  talk  on  the  phone  without  it  . 
2_cell_pos_67	Admittedly  , 
2_cell_pos_68	it  is  a  bit  difficult  to  get  into  your  ear  -- 
2_cell_pos_69	I  'd  say 
2_cell_pos_70	it  takes  upward  of  2  seconds  to  get  in  properly 
2_cell_pos_71	-LRB-  before  you  `  re  good  and  practiced  at  it  -RRB-  , 
2_cell_pos_72	which  may  not  sound  like  a  lot  , 
2_cell_pos_73	but  it  's  long  enough 
2_cell_pos_74	to  not  recognize  somebody  's  voice  or  hear  the  first  sentence  they  say  ,  or  whatever  . 
2_cell_pos_75	A  \*  very  mild  \*  frustration  . 
2_cell_pos_76	But  like  all  things  good  and  pleasant  , 
2_cell_pos_77	it  takes  a  little  practice 
2_cell_pos_78	to  get  it  just  right  and  now  I  have  it  so  that  I  can  answer  the  phone  ,  slip  the  EarBoom  in  my  ear 
2_cell_pos_79	and  start  a  conversation 
2_cell_pos_80	without  missing  a  beat  . 
2_cell_pos_81	In  fact  ,  I  find  this  earpiece  to  be  so  comfortable 
2_cell_pos_82	that  I  forget 
2_cell_pos_83	that  it  's  in  until  I  go  to  scratch  my  ear  or  something  ! 
2_cell_pos_84	The  other  complaint  that  I  saw  on  here  was  that  it  's  not  compatible  with  Nokia  phones  . 
2_cell_pos_85	In  fact  , 
2_cell_pos_86	it  even  says 
2_cell_pos_87	right 
2_cell_pos_88	on  the  package  that  it  's  not  compatible  with  Nokia  . 
2_cell_pos_89	That  's  funny  , 
2_cell_pos_90	I  have  a  Nokia  3589i 
2_cell_pos_91	and  it  works  just  fine  . 
2_cell_pos_92	They  make  two  other  models  of  EarBoom 
2_cell_pos_93	-LRB-  one  of  which  clearly  would  not  have  worked  with  my  phone  -RRB-  , 
2_cell_pos_94	both  of  which  claim  to  be  Nokia  compatible  , 
2_cell_pos_95	and  \*  neither  \*  of  those  works  with  my  phone  ! 
2_cell_pos_96	Confusing  ? 
2_cell_pos_97	Yes  ! 
2_cell_pos_98	The  problem  is  it  does  n't  work  with  \*  all  \*  Nokia  phones  . 
2_cell_pos_99	While  browsing  at  the  store 
2_cell_pos_100	I  noticed  that  the  ones 
2_cell_pos_101	that  claimed  to  be  Nokia  compatible  had  a  list  of  phones 
2_cell_pos_102	that  it  works  with  , 
2_cell_pos_103	but  it  did  n't  include  mine 
2_cell_pos_104	-LRB-  it  included  one 
2_cell_pos_105	that  was  ,  numerically  speaking  ,  very  close  to  my  model  : 
2_cell_pos_106	the  3590  -RRB-  ; 
2_cell_pos_107	which  piqued  my  curiosity  . 
2_cell_pos_108	And  so  I  went  to  the  friendly  manager  of  the  store  that  I  was  in  and  he  opened  two  of  the  different  packages  for  me 
2_cell_pos_109	and  let 
2_cell_pos_110	me  test  both  of  them  . 
2_cell_pos_111	One  of  them  worked  ,  the  other  did  n't  . 
2_cell_pos_112	The  strange  part  of  it  was  that  we  could  n't  see  a  visible  difference  in  the  two  units  .  .  . 
2_cell_pos_113	and  then  one  of  us  noticed  that  on  one  of  them  the  jack  had  two  small  black  stripes  around  it 
2_cell_pos_114	-LRB-  that  's  this  one  ,  and  if  you  look  closely  at  the  picture 
2_cell_pos_115	you  can  see  them  -RRB-  , 
2_cell_pos_116	while  the  other  one 
2_cell_pos_117	-LRB-  the  one  marked  as  Nokia  compatible  -RRB- 
2_cell_pos_118	had  three  . 
2_cell_pos_119	Hmmm  .  .  . 
2_cell_pos_120	Curious  . 
2_cell_pos_121	So  my  advice  is  to  either  know  your  phone  well 
2_cell_pos_122	-LRB-  as  in  ,  have  the  little  book  handy  -RRB- 
2_cell_pos_123	or  ask  for  help 
2_cell_pos_124	before  purchasing  . 
2_cell_pos_125	All  in  all  4  of  5  stars  . 
2_cell_pos_126	I  'd  give  it  5  stars  on  performance  and  comfort  , 
2_cell_pos_127	but  have  to  take  it  down  a  notch  for  an  extended  period  of  getting  used  to  it  and  for  confusing  packaging  . 
2_cell_pos_128	Addendum  : 
2_cell_pos_129	Several  months  later  the  little  piece  of  foam  has  fallen  from  the  end  of  the  boom  so  that  any  sound  from  the  wind  becomes  almost  unbearably  loud  for  the  person  at  the  other  end  .  .  . 
2_cell_pos_130	And  living  in  windy  Providence  , 
2_cell_pos_131	this  is  a  bit  of  an  annoyance  . 
2_cell_pos_132	Also  ,  for  a  while 
2_cell_pos_133	I  was  having  a  problem 
2_cell_pos_134	where  the  earpiece  would  cut  out  for  seconds  at  a  time  so  that  I  could  n't  hear  the  person  on  the  other  end  of  the  line 
2_cell_pos_135	-LRB-  and  ,  likewise  , 
2_cell_pos_136	they  could  n't  hear  me  -RRB- 
2_cell_pos_137	unless  I  jiggled  the  little  jack  . 
2_cell_pos_138	This  was  \*  very  \*  FRUSTRATING  . 
2_cell_pos_139	\*\* 
2_cell_pos_140	Now  ,  for  some  reason  , 
2_cell_pos_141	I  'm  not  having  that  problem  anymore  . 
2_cell_pos_142	I  'm  not  really  sure  if  the  problem  was  due  to  my  phone  or  the  EarBoom  . 
2_cell_pos_143	Either  way  ,  it  's  something  buyers  should  be  aware  of 
20_kitchen_pos_1	"It  's  a  three-piece  roasting  rack  --  two  sides  and  a  long  ""  pin  "" "
20_kitchen_pos_2	that  holds  them  together  . 
20_kitchen_pos_3	When  assembled 
20_kitchen_pos_4	it  has  a  rounded  bottom  and  tall  sides  with  handles  . 
20_kitchen_pos_5	It  's  supposed  to  handle  up  to  a  25  lb  turkey  , 
20_kitchen_pos_6	and 
20_kitchen_pos_7	after  using  it  with  a  22  lb  turkey  I  believe  that  claim  . 
20_kitchen_pos_8	The  tall  sides  and  handles  make 
20_kitchen_pos_9	it  easy 
20_kitchen_pos_10	to  remove  your  turkey  from  your  roasting  pan  , 
20_kitchen_pos_11	and  the  wide  rounded  base  holds  the  turkey  nicely  up  out  of  the  drippings  without  crushing  the  rib  cage 
20_kitchen_pos_12	the  way  angled 
20_kitchen_pos_13	racks  do  . 
20_kitchen_pos_14	In  fact  ,  my  only  beef  with  the  shape  was  that  it  was  too  wide  to  fit  in  our  Maxam  Steel  Roaster  , 
20_kitchen_pos_15	which  is  currently  my  favorite  roasting  pan  . 
20_kitchen_pos_16	The  truly  cool  thing  about  this  rack  ,  however  ,  is  n't  the  handles  or  the  shape  . 
20_kitchen_pos_17	It  's  that  nifty  pin  at  the  bottom  . 
20_kitchen_pos_18	You  see  , 
20_kitchen_pos_19	you  just  put  your  racked  turkey  down  on  its  carving  platter 
20_kitchen_pos_20	and  pull  the  pin  , 
20_kitchen_pos_21	then 
20_kitchen_pos_22	you  simply  remove  the  sides  . 
20_kitchen_pos_23	That  's  it  . 
20_kitchen_pos_24	They  pull  right  away  from  the  turkey  , 
20_kitchen_pos_25	leaving  it  behind  on  its  platter  . 
20_kitchen_pos_26	No  more  trying  to  lever  it  out  of  your  pan  or  off  of  its  rack  ; 
20_kitchen_pos_27	it  's  right 
20_kitchen_pos_28	where  you  want  it  already  . 
20_kitchen_pos_29	For  all  of  its  non-stick  properties  the  rack  did  take  some  real  elbow-grease 
20_kitchen_pos_30	to  clean  --  particularly 
20_kitchen_pos_31	when  trying  to  get  turkey  goo  out  of  the  crevices  between  bars  -- 
20_kitchen_pos_32	but  that  is  n't  very  surprising  . 
20_kitchen_pos_33	It  does  make 
20_kitchen_pos_34	it  unfortunate  that  the  dishwasher  is  not  recommended  for  this  product  ,  however  . 
20_kitchen_pos_35	Also  , 
20_kitchen_pos_36	there  is  one  problem 
20_kitchen_pos_37	that  did  bother  us  ; 
20_kitchen_pos_38	it  seems 
20_kitchen_pos_39	that  some  of  the  non-stick  coating  at  the  bottom  of  the  rack  flaked  off  during  cooking  . 
20_kitchen_pos_40	We  thought 
20_kitchen_pos_41	that  perhaps  the  initial  30  minutes  at  500  F  was  too  high  a  temperature  for  the  rack  , 
20_kitchen_pos_42	but  there  is  no  maximum  temperature 
20_kitchen_pos_43	listed  on  the  packaging  that  I  could  find  . 
20_kitchen_pos_44	I  'm  still  giving  this  item  a  rating  of  four 
20_kitchen_pos_45	because  it  's  just  so  incredibly  cool  an  idea  ,  and  so  remarkably  useful  , 
20_kitchen_pos_46	but  I  have  to  admit 
20_kitchen_pos_47	that  I  'm  not  thrilled  with  the  idea  of  a  non-stick  coating 
20_kitchen_pos_48	that  flakes  , 
20_kitchen_pos_49	and  I  wish 
20_kitchen_pos_50	the  item  was  dishwasher-safe  . 
20_kitchen_pos_51	I  'd  love  to  see  Cuisipro  develop  a  version  of  this  item 
20_kitchen_pos_52	made  out  of  a  better  material 
20_kitchen_neg_1	I  think  this  may  be  a  great  product  , 
20_kitchen_neg_2	and  is  why  I  bought  it  . 
20_kitchen_neg_3	However  ,  mine  NEVER  worked 
20_kitchen_neg_4	-LRB-  and  hence  was  never  actually  used  , 
20_kitchen_neg_5	it  was  just  taken  out  of  the  box  !  -RRB- 
20_kitchen_neg_6	The  remote  would  beep  the  collar 
20_kitchen_neg_7	but  not  spray  . 
20_kitchen_neg_8	Seller  did  have  manufacturer  send  new  batteries 
20_kitchen_neg_9	-LRB- 
20_kitchen_neg_10	which  further  delayed  my 
20_kitchen_neg_11	getting  a  good  response  to  this  situation  -RRB-  . 
20_kitchen_neg_12	New  batteries  arrived  ,  item  still  did  n't  spray  , 
20_kitchen_neg_13	but  seller  would  only  refer  me  to  dealing  directly  with  the  manufacturer  , 
20_kitchen_neg_14	to  get  a  replacement  , 
20_kitchen_neg_15	even  though  I  responded 
20_kitchen_neg_16	within  their  advertised  30  day  return  policy  . 
20_kitchen_neg_17	Please  read  seller  information  and  return  policies  CAREFULLY  ! 
20_kitchen_neg_18	Even  if  you  get 
20_kitchen_neg_19	them  to  take  something  back 
20_kitchen_neg_20	-LRB- 
20_kitchen_neg_21	only  if  never  opened  .  .  . 
20_kitchen_neg_22	if  opened  and  does  n't  work  , 
20_kitchen_neg_23	they  toss 
20_kitchen_neg_24	you 
20_kitchen_neg_25	to  the  manufacturer  -RRB-  , 
20_kitchen_neg_26	there  is  a  25  %  RESTOCKING  FEE  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ! 
20_kitchen_neg_27	Pretty  exorbitant  and  not  Amazon  type  service  I  have  come  to  expect  over  many  years  of  buying  from  Amazon  ! 
20_kitchen_neg_28	Be  very  careful  of  sellers 
20_kitchen_neg_29	that  are  not  Amazon  .  .  .  sometimes  it  is  n't  very  clear  it  is  not  Amazon  . 
20_kitchen_neg_30	My  feedback  on  Seller  is  on  feedback  page  and  seller  responded  , 
20_kitchen_neg_31	but  I  do  n't  get  a  chance 
20_kitchen_neg_32	to  respond  to  their  feedback  , 
20_kitchen_neg_33	which  gives  the  misconception 
20_kitchen_neg_34	that  I  actually  used  this  product  ! 
20_kitchen_neg_35	I  could  n't  have  used  it 
20_kitchen_neg_36	as  it  did  n't  work  ! 
20_kitchen_neg_37	If  you  want  to  buy  this  , 
20_kitchen_neg_38	I  'd  recommend  a  reputable  pet  store  such  as  Pet  Smart 
20_kitchen_neg_39	where  you  can  easily  take  an  item  back  if  it  does  n't  work  and  get  a  refund  . 
20_kitchen_neg_40	Even  if  they  are  willing  to  replace  something  , 
20_kitchen_neg_41	you  may  not  want  to  risk  having  future  problems  with  it  in  a  month  or  two 
20_kitchen_neg_42	and  would  want  a  refund  , 
20_kitchen_neg_43	which  most  stores  have  no  problem  with  doing  for  you  . 
20_kitchen_neg_44	Next  time  I  go  the  established  pet  stores 
14_gourmet_pos_1	I  have  been  using  a  Chemex  10-cup  coffee  maker  for  almost  a  year 
14_gourmet_pos_2	and  have  never  had  such  good  coffee  before  in  my  life  . 
14_gourmet_pos_3	I  am  constantly  looking  forward  to  my  next  pot  of  coffee  ! 
14_gourmet_pos_4	There  is  a  downside  to  this  coffee  maker  : 
14_gourmet_pos_5	it  is  a  more  manual  procedure  than  what  you  are  used  to  , 
14_gourmet_pos_6	and  it  also  takes  a  couple  of  pots 
14_gourmet_pos_7	to  learn 
14_gourmet_pos_8	how  to  use  this  most  efficiently  . 
14_gourmet_pos_9	The  first  time  I  tried  to  use  mine  , 
14_gourmet_pos_10	I  had  ground  my  coffee  way  too  finely  and  it  just  took  forever  ! 
14_gourmet_pos_11	The  big  time  consumers  : 
14_gourmet_pos_12	you  have  to  boil  your  water  separately 
14_gourmet_pos_13	-LRB-  you  do  have  a  water  kettle  right  ?  -RRB- 
14_gourmet_pos_14	and  then  you  have  to  gradually  pour  the  boiled  water  through  the  Chemex  . 
14_gourmet_pos_15	This  means  that  while  the  coffee  is  brewing  , 
14_gourmet_pos_16	you  are  pouring  ,  or  watching  ,  or  giving  the  filter  area  a  bit  of  a  stir  . 
14_gourmet_pos_17	Now  the  up  side  : 
14_gourmet_pos_18	you  will  never  ever  ever  drink  a  better  cup  of  coffee  . 
14_gourmet_pos_19	I  use  filtered  water  ,  freshly  ground  home  roasted  beans  ,  and  this  Chemex  to  produce  the  finest  coffee 
14_gourmet_pos_20	I  have  ever  had  the  pleasure  of  drinking  . 
14_gourmet_pos_21	And  this  coffee  is  a  pleasure  ! 
14_gourmet_pos_22	In  fact  , 
14_gourmet_pos_23	I  `  ve  totally  given  up  using  cream  and  sugar 
14_gourmet_pos_24	because  my  coffee  no  longer  has  anything  to  hide  . 
14_gourmet_pos_25	Another  up  side  : 
14_gourmet_pos_26	clean  up  means 
14_gourmet_pos_27	swishing  the  Chemex  with  warm  water 
14_gourmet_pos_28	and  tossing  the  water  down  the  drain  . 
14_gourmet_pos_29	You  can  also  wash  with  a  bottle  brush 
14_gourmet_pos_30	but  this  is  rarely  necessary  . 
14_gourmet_pos_31	A  brief  swish  is  really  all 
14_gourmet_pos_32	it  takes  to  get  your  Chemex 
14_gourmet_pos_33	looking  factory  new  . 
14_gourmet_pos_34	Try  that  with  your  electric  drip  machine  ! 
14_gourmet_pos_35	Ha  ! 
14_gourmet_pos_36	That  thing  will  NEVER  look  brand  new  ! 
14_gourmet_pos_37	Oh  ,  here  's  a  final  upside  : 
14_gourmet_pos_38	this  Chemex  brews  the  best  coffee 
14_gourmet_pos_39	you  `  ll  ever  drink  , 
14_gourmet_pos_40	and  it  costs  less  than  just  about  anything  . 
14_gourmet_pos_41	You  are  probably  already  spending  more  money  than  this  every  month  at  Starbucks  ! 
14_gourmet_pos_42	Go  ahead 
14_gourmet_pos_43	and  buy  yourself  one  of  these  . 
14_gourmet_pos_44	If  necessary  ,  wake  up  10  minutes  earlier  to  make  your  coffee  . 
14_gourmet_pos_45	Better  yet  ,  wake  up  20  minutes  earlier  . 
14_gourmet_pos_46	And 
14_gourmet_pos_47	when  your  coffee  is  ready  ,  instead  of  dumping  it  into  a  travel  cup 
14_gourmet_pos_48	and  bolting  out  the  door  ,  sit  down 
14_gourmet_pos_49	and  enjoy  your  first  cup  for  the  next  10  minutes  . 
14_gourmet_pos_50	You  deserve  it 
13_gourmet_neg_1	These  big  internet  companies  are  so  good  at  screwing  their  companies  . 
13_gourmet_neg_2	Do  you  see 
13_gourmet_neg_3	how 
13_gourmet_neg_4	this  scam  works  ?  ?  ? 
13_gourmet_neg_5	"They  sell  ""  FRESH  WHOLE  RABBIT  "" "
13_gourmet_neg_6	but  when  I  order  it  , 
13_gourmet_neg_7	there  's  no  head  or  skin  ! 
13_gourmet_neg_8	Can 
13_gourmet_neg_9	you  believe  ?  ! 
13_gourmet_neg_10	Uh  , 
13_gourmet_neg_11	excuse  me  , 
13_gourmet_neg_12	do  you  think  a  headless  rabbit 
13_gourmet_neg_13	"missing  its  entire  skin  is  ""  WHOLE  ""  ?  ?  ? "
13_gourmet_neg_14	This  is  totally  misleading  . 
13_gourmet_neg_15	I  have  contacted  Amazon  3  times  asking  them  to  please  send  me  the  skin  ,  feet  , 
13_gourmet_neg_16	and  head  so  I  have  the  complete  set 
13_gourmet_neg_17	and  they  have  ignored  me  or  sent  me  autoresponder  emails 
13_gourmet_neg_18	that  do  n't  specifically  address  the  missing  head  and  so  on  . 
13_gourmet_neg_19	What  they  do  , 
13_gourmet_neg_20	I  'm  guessing  ,  is  then  resell  rabbit  heads  ,  rabbit  feet  ,  and  bloody  rabbit  scalps  on  another  part  of  this  website  , 
13_gourmet_neg_21	and  it  's  all  pure  profit  . 
13_gourmet_neg_22	What  a  CROCK
