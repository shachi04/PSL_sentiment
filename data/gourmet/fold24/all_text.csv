4_gourmet_neg_1	I read the other reviews
4_gourmet_neg_2	and was greatly excited to order this entree .
4_gourmet_neg_3	I have bought 2-3 varieties of Tasty Bite from my local Trader Joes .
4_gourmet_neg_4	Most are decently healthy
4_gourmet_neg_5	and all are easy and fast to make .
4_gourmet_neg_6	Peas and paneer , as an entree , is bland and without any heat\/spice .
4_gourmet_neg_7	I am a native Indian
4_gourmet_neg_8	so I can handle relatively spicy food .
4_gourmet_neg_9	However ,
4_gourmet_neg_10	this entree does not merit even a 2-chili rating
4_gourmet_neg_11	-LRB- out of four -RRB- .
4_gourmet_neg_12	As for food quality ,
4_gourmet_neg_13	I would suggest
4_gourmet_neg_14	microwaving the rice
4_gourmet_neg_15	and entree separately .
4_gourmet_neg_16	Otherwise , the majority of the sauce seeps into the rice
4_gourmet_neg_17	giving it a very unpleasant appearance .
4_gourmet_neg_18	If you boil the pouches
4_gourmet_neg_19	-LRB- an alternate option -RRB- ,
4_gourmet_neg_20	you may have even more success .
4_gourmet_neg_21	However , most of us buy these because of the ease of preparation ,
4_gourmet_neg_22	so boiling is n't a convenient option .
4_gourmet_neg_23	The rice tastes
4_gourmet_neg_24	and looks as it should .
4_gourmet_neg_25	Finally ,
4_gourmet_neg_26	I do recommend Tasty Bite Entr e , Jaipur Vegetables .
4_gourmet_neg_27	I am on box nine of twelve
4_gourmet_neg_28	and still not tired .
4_gourmet_neg_29	This entree is MUCH spicier - closer
4_gourmet_neg_30	to a 3.25 chili rating
4_gourmet_neg_31	-LRB- out of four -RRB- .
4_gourmet_neg_32	I also favor this entree
4_gourmet_neg_33	because it does n't have the throw-away plastic container in each box .
4_gourmet_neg_34	Moreover ,
4_gourmet_neg_35	you get 12-boxes for a better price than the 6-boxes for the peas and paneer .
4_gourmet_neg_36	I look forward to trying the other Tasty Bites ,
4_gourmet_neg_37	though I will likely sample the flavors at Trader Joe 's before ordering another 6 - or 12-box set .
4_gourmet_neg_38	No more Tasty Bite purchases from the Gold Box unless I have already tried that particular flavor - lesson learned
