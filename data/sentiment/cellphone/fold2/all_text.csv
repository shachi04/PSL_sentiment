2_cell_pos_1	I think this is a pretty good earpiece . . .
2_cell_pos_2	granted ,
2_cell_pos_3	I ` ve only used one other
2_cell_pos_4	-LRB- it was a flimsy little thing
2_cell_pos_5	that came w \/ my friend 's Nokia -RRB- ,
2_cell_pos_6	but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comfort .
2_cell_pos_7	Where my friend 's would fall out of my ear , this one
2_cell_pos_8	-LRB- once I got
2_cell_pos_9	it figured out -RRB-
2_cell_pos_10	never comes loose .
2_cell_pos_11	Second ,
2_cell_pos_12	listening to people on my friend 's ,
2_cell_pos_13	I would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well ,
2_cell_pos_14	and then they sounded muffled and distorted ;
2_cell_pos_15	but on my Jabra
2_cell_pos_16	I can actually turn down the volume on my phone
2_cell_pos_17	and they sound crisp and clear -- moreso than when I 'm not using the earpiece .
2_cell_pos_18	Finally ,
2_cell_pos_19	when my friend calls me
2_cell_pos_20	and uses her earpiece ,
2_cell_pos_21	she sounds distant
2_cell_pos_22	and muffled ;
2_cell_pos_23	I ` ve had no complaints from the people
2_cell_pos_24	I 'm talking to using the Jabra ,
2_cell_pos_25	and ,
2_cell_pos_26	in fact ,
2_cell_pos_27	my mom said
2_cell_pos_28	it sounds better
2_cell_pos_29	when I use the EarBoom than when I do n't .
2_cell_pos_30	The ear gels are a bit hard to get
2_cell_pos_31	used to .
2_cell_pos_32	They are oddly shaped
2_cell_pos_33	-LRB-
2_cell_pos_34	as you can see in the picture -RRB- ,
2_cell_pos_35	and there are six of them total -- three of them for each ear .
2_cell_pos_36	Lots of reviewers complained about the fit and comfort of the ear gels ,
2_cell_pos_37	while others claim
2_cell_pos_38	these are the most comfortable earpieces
2_cell_pos_39	they ` ve used and that they fit perfectly . . .
2_cell_pos_40	I can honesly say
2_cell_pos_41	I ` ve had both experiences .
2_cell_pos_42	When I first got this unit the earpiece kept falling out everytime
2_cell_pos_43	that I would turn my head :
2_cell_pos_44	\* very \* frustrating .
2_cell_pos_45	I tried
2_cell_pos_46	pushing it into my ear as hard as I could ,
2_cell_pos_47	I tried
2_cell_pos_48	holding it in place with my hand , but that only seemed to defeat the purpose of having a hands-free earpiece .
2_cell_pos_49	Nothing seemed to work .
2_cell_pos_50	I was thinking of returning it .
2_cell_pos_51	I was thinking of throwing it into traffic on I-95 .
2_cell_pos_52	And then one day , somehow , I came to the realization that you have to sort of twist it into your ear -- with the little poky-out part stuck in the fold of your ear next to the ear canal
2_cell_pos_53	-LRB- not the fold on the top of your ear ;
2_cell_pos_54	if you do
2_cell_pos_55	that it ` ll just pop out again -RRB- --
2_cell_pos_56	and then \* voila \* it stays put .
2_cell_pos_57	Matter o ' fact ,
2_cell_pos_58	it ` ll stay put so well that it ` ll be a little bit difficult
2_cell_pos_59	-- even \* painful \* --
2_cell_pos_60	to get out again .
2_cell_pos_61	I can imagine that people with different ear sizes , different patience levels , and lower IQs might have different experiences than my own .
2_cell_pos_62	But all I can say is that once I had this little bugger
2_cell_pos_63	figured out ,
2_cell_pos_64	I was golden .
2_cell_pos_65	I love this thing
2_cell_pos_66	and almost never talk on the phone without it .
2_cell_pos_67	Admittedly ,
2_cell_pos_68	it is a bit difficult to get into your ear --
2_cell_pos_69	I 'd say
2_cell_pos_70	it takes upward of 2 seconds to get in properly
2_cell_pos_71	-LRB- before you ` re good and practiced at it -RRB- ,
2_cell_pos_72	which may not sound like a lot ,
2_cell_pos_73	but it 's long enough
2_cell_pos_74	to not recognize somebody 's voice or hear the first sentence they say , or whatever .
2_cell_pos_75	A \* very mild \* frustration .
2_cell_pos_76	But like all things good and pleasant ,
2_cell_pos_77	it takes a little practice
2_cell_pos_78	to get it just right and now I have it so that I can answer the phone , slip the EarBoom in my ear
2_cell_pos_79	and start a conversation
2_cell_pos_80	without missing a beat .
2_cell_pos_81	In fact , I find this earpiece to be so comfortable
2_cell_pos_82	that I forget
2_cell_pos_83	that it 's in until I go to scratch my ear or something !
2_cell_pos_84	The other complaint that I saw on here was that it 's not compatible with Nokia phones .
2_cell_pos_85	In fact ,
2_cell_pos_86	it even says
2_cell_pos_87	right
2_cell_pos_88	on the package that it 's not compatible with Nokia .
2_cell_pos_89	That 's funny ,
2_cell_pos_90	I have a Nokia 3589i
2_cell_pos_91	and it works just fine .
2_cell_pos_92	They make two other models of EarBoom
2_cell_pos_93	-LRB- one of which clearly would not have worked with my phone -RRB- ,
2_cell_pos_94	both of which claim to be Nokia compatible ,
2_cell_pos_95	and \* neither \* of those works with my phone !
2_cell_pos_96	Confusing ?
2_cell_pos_97	Yes !
2_cell_pos_98	The problem is it does n't work with \* all \* Nokia phones .
2_cell_pos_99	While browsing at the store
2_cell_pos_100	I noticed that the ones
2_cell_pos_101	that claimed to be Nokia compatible had a list of phones
2_cell_pos_102	that it works with ,
2_cell_pos_103	but it did n't include mine
2_cell_pos_104	-LRB- it included one
2_cell_pos_105	that was , numerically speaking , very close to my model :
2_cell_pos_106	the 3590 -RRB- ;
2_cell_pos_107	which piqued my curiosity .
2_cell_pos_108	And so I went to the friendly manager of the store that I was in and he opened two of the different packages for me
2_cell_pos_109	and let
2_cell_pos_110	me test both of them .
2_cell_pos_111	One of them worked , the other did n't .
2_cell_pos_112	The strange part of it was that we could n't see a visible difference in the two units . . .
2_cell_pos_113	and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it
2_cell_pos_114	-LRB- that 's this one , and if you look closely at the picture
2_cell_pos_115	you can see them -RRB- ,
2_cell_pos_116	while the other one
2_cell_pos_117	-LRB- the one marked as Nokia compatible -RRB-
2_cell_pos_118	had three .
2_cell_pos_119	Hmmm . . .
2_cell_pos_120	Curious .
2_cell_pos_121	So my advice is to either know your phone well
2_cell_pos_122	-LRB- as in , have the little book handy -RRB-
2_cell_pos_123	or ask for help
2_cell_pos_124	before purchasing .
2_cell_pos_125	All in all 4 of 5 stars .
2_cell_pos_126	I 'd give it 5 stars on performance and comfort ,
2_cell_pos_127	but have to take it down a notch for an extended period of getting used to it and for confusing packaging .
2_cell_pos_128	Addendum :
2_cell_pos_129	Several months later the little piece of foam has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sound from the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end . . .
2_cell_pos_130	And living in windy Providence ,
2_cell_pos_131	this is a bit of an annoyance .
2_cell_pos_132	Also , for a while
2_cell_pos_133	I was having a problem
2_cell_pos_134	where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a time so that I could n't hear the person on the other end of the line
2_cell_pos_135	-LRB- and , likewise ,
2_cell_pos_136	they could n't hear me -RRB-
2_cell_pos_137	unless I jiggled the little jack .
2_cell_pos_138	This was \* very \* FRUSTRATING .
2_cell_pos_139	\*\*
2_cell_pos_140	Now , for some reason ,
2_cell_pos_141	I 'm not having that problem anymore .
2_cell_pos_142	I 'm not really sure if the problem was due to my phone or the EarBoom .
2_cell_pos_143	Either way , it 's something buyers should be aware of
