1_gourmet_neg_1	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_0	I really do like my Senseo coffee maker .
1_gourmet_neg_2	positive	False	1_gourmet_neg_1	I , like others
1_gourmet_neg_3	positive	False	1_gourmet_neg_2	who have reviewed the Kona Pods here , was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine .
1_gourmet_neg_4	positive	False	1_gourmet_neg_3	I was excited to see
1_gourmet_neg_5	positive	False	1_gourmet_neg_4	that Kona now made pods
1_gourmet_neg_6	positive	False	1_gourmet_neg_5	and was also happy to see
1_gourmet_neg_7	positive	False	1_gourmet_neg_6	that they had a pod
1_gourmet_neg_8	positive	False	1_gourmet_neg_7	that was a ' 2 cup style ' .
1_gourmet_neg_9	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_8	I have not found it to be a huge deal
1_gourmet_neg_10	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_9	to use 2 smaller '
1_gourmet_neg_11	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_10	1 cup ' size pods ,
1_gourmet_neg_12	positive	False	1_gourmet_neg_11	but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of 2 smaller one .
1_gourmet_neg_13	negative	True	1_gourmet_neg_12	After reading some of the reviews here ,
1_gourmet_neg_14	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_13	I could not figure out
1_gourmet_neg_15	negative	True	1_gourmet_neg_14	what some of the reviewers meant by the Kona pods
1_gourmet_neg_16	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_15	making different amount of coffee per cup each time or how the coffee could be strange and undrinkable .
1_gourmet_neg_17	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_16	It just did n't make sense .
1_gourmet_neg_18	negative	True	1_gourmet_neg_17	Well ,
1_gourmet_neg_19	negative	True	1_gourmet_neg_18	it still does n't make sense ,
1_gourmet_neg_20	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_19	but it certainly happened with the coffee
1_gourmet_neg_21	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_20	I made using the Kona pods also .
1_gourmet_neg_22	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_21	My results were overall poor and it was very disappointing as the Kona pods cost a lot more than Folgers or other pod brands that I can buy locally .
1_gourmet_neg_23	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_22	The first thing I noticed was that the coffee in the 2 cup sized Kona pods is packed in much
1_gourmet_neg_24	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_23	more tightly than in any other pod
1_gourmet_neg_25	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_24	I have ever used in my Senseo .
1_gourmet_neg_26	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_25	The instructions for the Kona pods say
1_gourmet_neg_27	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_26	to wiggle the pods to break up the coffee before inserting into the machine .
1_gourmet_neg_28	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_27	The Kona pods feel very hard
1_gourmet_neg_29	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_28	when taken out of their package .
1_gourmet_neg_30	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_29	I always wiggled and jiggled the pods for about 10 seconds
1_gourmet_neg_31	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_30	before putting them in the Senseo .
1_gourmet_neg_32	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_31	After my problems with the Kona pods ,
1_gourmet_neg_33	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_32	my husband decided that I was not ' wiggling '
1_gourmet_neg_34	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_33	them enough .
1_gourmet_neg_35	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_34	He promptly wiggled one to the point that it broke open .
1_gourmet_neg_36	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_35	So ,
1_gourmet_neg_37	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_36	there is just so much
1_gourmet_neg_38	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_37	that can be done to the pod
1_gourmet_neg_39	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_38	before putting it in the machine .
1_gourmet_neg_40	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_39	The first thing that I noticed was that the amount of coffee
1_gourmet_neg_41	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_40	brewed
1_gourmet_neg_42	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_41	when using the Kona pod was quite a bit less than when using 2 smaller pods .
1_gourmet_neg_43	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_42	That did not make much sense ,
1_gourmet_neg_44	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_43	but after several cups of Kona ,
1_gourmet_neg_45	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_44	it was obvious
1_gourmet_neg_46	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_45	that there was never the amount of coffee
1_gourmet_neg_47	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_46	coming out as before when using 2 small one cup pods .
1_gourmet_neg_48	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_47	The best I can figure out is that the Kona pods
1_gourmet_neg_49	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_48	themselves seem to ' hold ' a lot more water .
1_gourmet_neg_50	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_49	There is more water
1_gourmet_neg_51	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_50	that remains in the pod itself
1_gourmet_neg_52	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_51	after the brewing is done .
1_gourmet_neg_53	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_52	The pod itself is heavier
1_gourmet_neg_54	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_53	when I take
1_gourmet_neg_55	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_54	it out to throw it away .
1_gourmet_neg_56	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_55	So ,
1_gourmet_neg_57	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_56	I believe
1_gourmet_neg_58	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_57	the reason
1_gourmet_neg_59	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_58	that there is less actual coffee using Kona pods is that the pods themselves retain a lot more water
1_gourmet_neg_60	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_59	and it can not pass through into the coffee cup .
1_gourmet_neg_61	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_60	Then ,
1_gourmet_neg_62	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_61	as others have mentioned ,
1_gourmet_neg_63	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_62	there is the problem
1_gourmet_neg_64	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_63	that happens to me about 1\/2 the time
1_gourmet_neg_65	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_64	when using the Kona pods .
1_gourmet_neg_66	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_65	The problem is that for whatever reason ,
1_gourmet_neg_67	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_66	the water does not actually go through
1_gourmet_neg_68	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_67	and penetrate the Kona pods during the brewing cycle .
1_gourmet_neg_69	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_68	The ' coffee '
1_gourmet_neg_70	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_69	that is supposed to be coming out of the spout is just water !
1_gourmet_neg_71	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_70	This problem is one that I still can not really figure out .
1_gourmet_neg_72	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_71	The Kona pods are a little smaller in diameter than all the other pods
1_gourmet_neg_73	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_72	I have tried .
1_gourmet_neg_74	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_73	So ,
1_gourmet_neg_75	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_74	I guess that somehow the water has enough room to ' go around ' the actual pod
1_gourmet_neg_76	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_75	and come out of the spout without ' going through ' the pod
1_gourmet_neg_77	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_76	to brew coffee .
1_gourmet_neg_78	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_77	I also wonder if the paper filter of the Kona pods is different than other pods
1_gourmet_neg_79	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_78	and for some reason the Kona paper is more difficult for water
1_gourmet_neg_80	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_79	to penetrate .
1_gourmet_neg_81	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_80	I have tried
1_gourmet_neg_82	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_81	wetting the Kona pod paper filter right before starting to brew the coffee
1_gourmet_neg_83	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_82	thinking that perhaps it would help the water
1_gourmet_neg_84	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_83	to penetrate the paper and pod .
1_gourmet_neg_85	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_84	But , that has not worked for me .
1_gourmet_neg_86	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_85	So ,
1_gourmet_neg_87	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_86	it is back to regular more reasonably priced coffee pods for me .
1_gourmet_neg_88	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_87	I have wasted too many expensive Kona pods trying to get a proper cup of coffee from them .
1_gourmet_neg_89	negative	True	1_gourmet_neg_88	Even when the Kona pods brew a cup of coffee ,
1_gourmet_neg_90	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_89	it is not as large of an amount of coffee as I get
1_gourmet_neg_91	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_90	using other brands .
1_gourmet_neg_92	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_91	So ,
1_gourmet_neg_93	negative	True	1_gourmet_neg_92	adding the cost of the Kona pods to the fact
1_gourmet_neg_94	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_93	that it brews a smaller amount of coffee equals a product
1_gourmet_neg_95	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_94	that is way too expensive
1_gourmet_neg_96	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_95	when it does actually work .
1_gourmet_neg_97	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_96	I have been reading of a product
1_gourmet_neg_98	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_97	called an EcoPod .
1_gourmet_neg_99	negative	False	1_gourmet_neg_98	It is a refillable pod for these type of coffeemakers .
1_gourmet_neg_100	positive	False	1_gourmet_neg_99	It might be the next thing
1_gourmet_neg_101	positive	False	1_gourmet_neg_100	I try .
