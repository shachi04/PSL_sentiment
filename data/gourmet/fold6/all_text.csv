6_gourmet_pos_1	New to Thai cuisine ,
6_gourmet_pos_2	I asked to try a milder curry ,
6_gourmet_pos_3	my tastes
6_gourmet_pos_4	running to a maximum of medium heat .
6_gourmet_pos_5	Yellow curry was recommended , and the coconut milk based Thai version was a treat with both seafood and chicken-something
6_gourmet_pos_6	I ` ve had occasion
6_gourmet_pos_7	to order again and again .
6_gourmet_pos_8	So
6_gourmet_pos_9	when trying to re-create the taste sensations above ,
6_gourmet_pos_10	I was less than thrilled at the idea of grinding individual spices ,
6_gourmet_pos_11	purchasing a number of pricey ingredients with limited shelf life and narrow applications .
6_gourmet_pos_12	I did some research
6_gourmet_pos_13	and found that many Thai housewives rely on the time and labor savings of using high quality curry pastes as the basis for soups , curries and more .
6_gourmet_pos_14	Mae Ploy was one of the brands repeatly mentioned as high quality and fresh tasting .
6_gourmet_pos_15	This brand comes in a handful of flavors and heat levels , with the Yellow Curry Paste being the first
6_gourmet_pos_16	I was eager to try .
6_gourmet_pos_17	It has a shelf life of 2 years ,
6_gourmet_pos_18	and the large plastic pouch also keeps very well nestled in its own colorful tub in the refrigerator .
6_gourmet_pos_19	The flavors of lemon grass , shallot , gingery galanga , kaffir lime peel , warm spices and red chili are very well balanced .
6_gourmet_pos_20	This is the only Mae Ploy Curry paste without shrimp paste ,
6_gourmet_pos_21	making it vegan-suitable as well as delicious with shellfish , fish or fowl .
6_gourmet_pos_22	I like to snip off one corner of the clear packet ,
6_gourmet_pos_23	then squeeze out just the amount
6_gourmet_pos_24	I need-anywhere from 1\/2 teaspoon to 2 Tablespoons ,
6_gourmet_pos_25	depending on the recipe .
6_gourmet_pos_26	This helps to maintain freshness and flavor
6_gourmet_pos_27	and avoid waste .
6_gourmet_pos_28	For Thai curry ,
6_gourmet_pos_29	I will combine the Yellow Curry Paste with a small amount of chicken broth ,
6_gourmet_pos_30	then add 3\/4 Cup more broth per person , plus a can of coconut milk to mellow and round the flavor .
6_gourmet_pos_31	A cup or two of chunked seafood or chicken , plus cubed potatoes and onion-simmered together for about 30 minutes - makes a very satisfying dish to serve with either traditional sticky rice or more the more occidental long grain variety .
6_gourmet_pos_32	Mae Ploy 's Thai Yellow Curry is also delicious with just a bit
6_gourmet_pos_33	added to your favorite dip , salad dressing , or try a teaspoonful
6_gourmet_pos_34	combined with 1 cup of sour cream or plain yogurt ' painted ' over your favorite fish fillets and baked just until cooked through ,
6_gourmet_pos_35	-LRB- about 15-20 minutes at 325 -RRB- .
6_gourmet_pos_36	The fine quality of this product has encouraged me to order another flavorful curry paste-also excellent-and
6_gourmet_pos_37	I would highly recommend this product for those
6_gourmet_pos_38	wishing to re-create favorite restaurant fare at a reasonal price ,
6_gourmet_pos_39	without tedious preparation
