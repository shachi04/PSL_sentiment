20_gourmet_neg_1	I thought my Fresh Vine Ripe Tomatoes would come whole .
20_gourmet_neg_2	Instead ,
20_gourmet_neg_3	as you can see from the graphic ,
20_gourmet_neg_4	I received five whole tomatoes and one
20_gourmet_neg_5	that had already been cut in half .
20_gourmet_neg_6	Yes , half a tomato .
20_gourmet_neg_7	The half-tomato in my package had dripped on the other ones
20_gourmet_neg_8	and made quite a mess .
20_gourmet_neg_9	In fact , the resulting tomato juice ate a hole through the box
20_gourmet_neg_10	they arrived in ,
20_gourmet_neg_11	making a puddle on the floor
20_gourmet_neg_12	that was small ,
20_gourmet_neg_13	but big enough
20_gourmet_neg_14	to trip the UPS guy .
20_gourmet_neg_15	He fell and fractured his spine ,
20_gourmet_neg_16	and now he 's paralyzed .
20_gourmet_neg_17	His wife and nine children are destitute , all thanks to these vine-ripened tomatoes .
20_gourmet_neg_18	In conclusion ,
20_gourmet_neg_19	I think
20_gourmet_neg_20	this packaging is just a bad idea
