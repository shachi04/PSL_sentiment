The  first  was  that  the  6011i  humidifier  would  not  run  on  the  High  speed  setting 	0.1875
but  did  run  on  the  low  and  medium  speed  settings  . 	0.0001
The  second  defect  was  that  the  cap  for  one  water  container  had  no  rubber 	0.25
o-ring  seal  and  the  water  bottle  leaked 	0.0001
when  upright  in  its  normal  operating  position  . 	0.0001
The  fact  that  this  6011i  humidifier  had  2  defects 	0.25
says 	0.0001
that  the  quality  control  for  this  product  must  be  very  low  and  implies  this  product  suffers  from  an  above  average  failure  rate  . 	0.2916666666666667
The  6011i  humidifier  has  major  design  defects 	0.4375
that  make 	0.0001
it  difficult  to  operate  and  maintain  the  6011i  humidifier  . 	0.0001
The  design  defects  are  so 	0.25
major 	0.625
that  the  person 	0.0001
-LRB-  s  -RRB- 	0.0001
that 	0.0001
designed  and  approved  the  design  of  the 	0.0001
6011i  humidifier  should  be  shot  or  at  least 	0.25
fired  ! 	0.0001
The  first  major  design  defect  is  that  the  water  bottles  will  not  stand  up  by  themselves 	0.4375
in  my  sink  . 	0.0001
Because  of  this  I  must  hold  the  water  containers  vertically  with  my  hand 	0.5
and  still  can  not  completely  fill  the  water  container  to  the  top  . 	0.5
The  screw-on  caps  for  the  water  containers  are  so  large 	0.25
they  are  difficult  for  my  wife  with  small  hands  to  screw  on 	0.3125
while  holding  the  water  container  vertically  upright  . 	0.0001
The  next  design  defect  is  that  one  can  not  at  a  glance  check  the  water  level  in  the  water  containers 	0.25
but  must  pick  up  the  water  containers 	0.0001
and  turn  them  over  to  check  the  water  level  in  the  container  . 	0.5
One  can  see  if  the  water  container  is  empty  or  nearly  empty  at  a  glance  , 	0.25
but  this  is  of  no  use  if  one  wants  to  quickly  see  if  there  is  enough  water  in  the  water  containers  to  last  until  one  returns  home  from  work  or  will  last  through  the  night  . 	0.20833333333333331
"The  last  design  defect  of  the  6011i  humidifier  is  that  the  water  containers  and  humidifier  fan  housing  do  not  just  ""  drop  into  place  ""  on  the  base  . "	0.1875
One  must  use  one  hand  as  a  guide  for  the  water  container  and  then  still  fiddle  with  the  position\/angle  of  the  water  container  to  get  it  to  seat  properly  . 	0.2916666666666667
This  is  even  more  difficult  if  both  water  containers  are  removed  for  filling  at  the  same  time  . 	0.20833333333333331
I  bought  this  6011i  humidifier 	0.0001
to  replace  a  Honeywell  humidifier 	0.0001
that  finally  failed  after  many  years  of  faithful  service  . 	0.625
I  also  selected  the  6011i  Humidifier 	0.0001
because  of  its  many  desirable  features  . 	0.5
However  the  positive  product  features  were  significantly  outweighed  by  the  poor  quality  control  and  the  poor  design  of  the  6011i  Humidifier  . 	0.34375
I  believe 	0.125
that  a  humidifier  should  be  designed  for  usability  first  and  esthetics  second  ,  not  the  other  way  around  as  is  the  case  with  the  6011i  humidifier  . 	0.3125
Thus  I  returned  the  6011i  humidifier 	0.0001
My  kid  was  upset 	0.25
when  I  got  him  an  improvised  Harry  Potter  broom  for  Christmas  --  O.  K  .  , 	0.125
it  was  n't  an  officially  licensed  product  , 	0.25
but  since  magic  brooms  are  imaginary  anyway  ,  any  stick  with  a  bunch  of  straw  at  one  end  is  as  good  as  any  other  . 	0.4166666666666667
But  no  --  apparently  a  Corn  Lobby  Broom  was  n't  good  enough  for  him  . 	0.40625
Anyway  ,  he  would  n't  talk  to  me  for  a  month  , 	0.0001
which  was  good  at  first  , 	0.5
but  then  got  really  annoying  . 	0.375
For  my  kid  's  birthday 	0.0001
I  decided  to  get 	0.125
him  something  really  special  , 	0.625
so  I  got  him  this  bag  of  xanthan  gum  . 	0.125
I  even  wrapped  it  up  real  nice  with  wrapping  paper  and  ribbon  . 	0.125
My  kid  opened  his  present 	0.0001
and  could  n't  figure  out  what  it  was  . 	0.25
"It  's  xanthan  gum  ,  "" "	0.0001

"No  it  's  not  ,  "" "	0.0001
he  slowly  replied  , 	0.0001
"and  then  he  began  to  read  ,  "" "	0.0001

My  kid  picked  up  the  spoon 	0.0001

"Go  on  ,  "" "	0.0001
I  said  , 	0.0001
"you  `  ll  really  like  it  !  "" "	0.625
He  hesitated  , 	0.0001
and  then  stuck  his  tongue  into  the  powder  . 	0.0001
I  was  starting  to  get  impatient  , 	0.1875
so  I  grabbed  the  spoon  from  him  , 	0.0001
Give  it  to  me  , 	0.0001
"you  big  chicken  ,  "" "	0.25
and  then  I  swallowed  the  powder  . 	0.0001
The  stuff 	0.0001
dissolved  into  a  thick  ,  slimy  paste  in  my  mouth  , 	0.0001
but  I  smiled 	0.0001
"as  I  chewed  it  ,  ""  Mmmmm  .  .  . "	0.0001
"this  is  the  tastiest  xanthan  gum  in  the  whole  universe  !  "" "	0.3333333333333333
My  kid  looked  at  me  as  if  I  were  lying  . 	0.25
If  you  like  it  so  much  , 	0.125
"then  you  can  have  it  ,  "" "	0.25
he  said  . 	0.0001
"Fine  ,  "" "	0.0001
I  replied  , 	0.0001
it  's  too  good  for  you 	0.4375
"anyway  .  "" "	0.0001
I  figured  a  little  reverse  psychology  would  do  the  trick  . 	0.0001
My  kid  's  expression  did  n't  change  . 	0.0001
"Can  I  go  now  ?  "" "	0.0001
he  asked  . 	0.0001
Yeah  , 	0.0001

"get  out  here  ,  "" "	0.0001
I  said  . 	0.0001
Now  I  'm  stuck  with  half  a  pound  of  xanthan  gum 	0.0001
and  I  do  n't  know  anyone  with  wheat  allergies  or  celiac  disease 	0.375
I  can  give  this  stuff  to  . 	0.0001
Stupid  kid 	0.0001
Do  n't  get 	0.125
me  wrong  -- 	0.0001
I  'm  not  some  nut  job 	0.0001
who  thinks  this  stuff  will  give  you  cancer  due  to  lack  of  testing  . 	0.125
I  'm  just  really  miffed  at  the  fact 	0.625
that  Splenda  has  plenty  of  carbohydrates  in  it  --  24  grams  per  cup  !  ! 	0.25
They  get  away  with  this  by  setting  their  serving  size  to  1  tsp  , 	0.125
which  is  0.5  g  . 	0.25
Would  you  believe  that  in  0.5  g  of  product 	0.125
there  is  less  than  one  gram  of  carbohydrate  !  ? 	0.25
No  way  !  ! 	0.0001
The  sweetener  sucralose  is  not  a  carbohydrate  , 	0.1875
but  since  it  's  600x  as  sweet  as  sugar  , 	0.0001
they  need 	0.25
to  bulk  it  up  to  make 	0.0001
it  measure  like  sugar  . 	0.0001
But  all  the  maltodextrin  they  use  for  filler  is  carbohydrates  . 	0.25
This  could  really  screw  up  somebody  on  Atkins  '  Induction  phase  . 	0.5
For  example  , 	0.0001
the  day  before  I  learned  this  , 	0.0001
I  made  some  Kool-Aid  with  Splenda  . 	0.0001
I  did  n't  know 	0.0001
that  in  2  quarts 	0.0001
I  was  drinking  down  24  carbs  ! 	0.25
What  to  do  ? 	0.0001
Find  somebody  online 	0.625
who  sells  liquid  sucralose  . 	0.0001
They  use  water  as  the  filler  , 	0.0001
it  's  super-concentrated  still  , 	0.0001
and  it  truly  has  0  carbs  . 	0.4375
I  look  forward  to  the  day 	0.25
when  McNeil  Nutritionals  meets  the  demand  for  ZERO-carb  Splenda  . 	0.0001
-LRB-  That  's  0.0  g  ,  not  0.49  g  ! 	0.0001
Purchased  this  phone  as  an  upgrade  from  the  i530  , 	0.0001
which  I  loved  . 	0.5
I  was  at  the  end  of  a  2  year  contract  ,  and  felt  that  I  would  get  something  with  a  few  more  bells  and  whistles  -  and  was  excited  about  the  color  screen  with  the  icons  . 	0.225
Two  of  my  family  members  have  higher  end  Nextels  and  all  work  well  . 	0.25
I  would  have  purchased  one  of  those  , 	0.25
except  I  did  n't  really  care  about  a  camera  for  my  phone  , 	0.5
and  this  one  was  reasonably  priced  .  .  . 	0.1875
and  I  found  out 	0.0001
you  get 	0.125
what  you  pay  for  ! 	0.0001
The  i560  felt  almost  cheap  in  construction 	0.0001
compared  to  the  i750  ,  i870  and  even  my  old  i530  . 	0.25
I  had  it  for  a  couple  of  weeks 	0.25
when  I  started  having  trouble  with  the  clarity  of  my  calls  - 	0.375
I  could  hear  them  , 	0.0001
but  they  could  n't  hear  me  . 	0.0001
A  couple  of  times  , 	0.5
I  had  the  screen  go  to  Airplane  Mode  , 	0.25
even  when  I  had  n't  touched  it  . 	0.1875
The  fact  that  you  had  to  take  the  whole  phone  out 	0.1875
to  see 	0.0001
who  is  calling  was  another  downside  ,  too  . 	0.2
My  previous  phone  had  to  be  flipped  open  to  see 	0.25
who  was  calling  , 	0.25
but  I  had  a  holster 	0.25
that  could  hold  the  phone  without  disengaging  it  . 	0.0001
Not  a  great  design  for  this  holster  . 	0.0001
Another  problem  is  with  the  power  supply  . 	0.25
When  charging  the  phone  , 	0.0001
it  is  especially  important  to  make  sure  the  plug  is  seated  tight  -  and  to  check 	0.425
that  is  says  device 	0.25
attached  - 	0.125
it  comes  out  easy 	0.625
and  stops  charging 	0.0001
even 	0.125
when  it  appears  to  be  plugged  into  the  phone  correctly  . 	0.25
Then  I  am  on  a  phone  call  on  speakerphone 	0.25
and  the  whole  speaker  just  stops  working  . 	0.125
Living  in  California  apparently  gives  us  an  advantage  -  30  day  risk  free  guarantee  . 	0.5

and 	0.0001
after  54  minutes  ,  one  accidental  disconnection  by  Nextel 	0.0001
and  6  customer  service  agents  , 	0.5
I  finally  received  a  return  authorization 	0.0001
and  placed  a  new  order  . 	0.375
Terrible  ,  terrible  phone  . 	0.0001
Stay  away  from  it  . 	0.0001
Hoping  the  new  one  on  it  's  way  works  much  better  ! 	0.375

So  I  bought  this  thing 	0.0001
based  on  the  Amazon  reviews 	0.125
and  saved  a  bundle  over  the  local  retail  cost 	0.5
-LRB-  yeah  Amazon  !  -RRB-  , 	0.125
but  that  's  not 	0.0001
why  I  'm  writing  this  review  . 	0.125
I  'd  like  to  talk  about  the  performance  and  comfort  of  the  Earboom  . 	0.125
The  eargel  thingies  are  designed  quite  well  ,  of  the  three  different  sizes  for  each  ear 	0.34375
you  `  re  bound  to  find  one 	0.0001
that  fits  very  comfortably  . 	0.5
Turns  out  I  could  n't  find  any 	0.0001
that  fit  my  right  ear  comfortably  for  extended  periods  of  use 	0.125
but  found  a  perfect  fit  in  my  mate  on  the  other  side  . 	0.0001
My  wife  had  the  exact  opposite  experience  -  hopefully  our  daughter  will  inherit  more  symmetrical  ears  ! 	0.375
I  hate  jogging  so  ca  n't  comment  on  the  fit  during  that  activity 	0.125
but  can  say  the  gels  fit 	0.75
suprising  well  in  the  folds  of  your  ear 	0.25
and  the  boom  is  quite  secure 	0.25
when  installed  . 	0.0001
I  'd  have  to  imagine 	0.25
it  'd  take  a  big  hit 	0.25
to  knock  it  loose  once  in  place  . 	0.375
Sound  quality  from  the  earbud  is  decent  , 	0.3125
but  I  feel 	0.125
the  Earboom  lacks  some  fidelity  ,  especially  the  higher  frequencies  . 	0.125
Normally  this  is  not  a  problem  , 	0.25
but  it  can  sometimes  make  the  person 	0.0001
you  `  re  talking  to  sound  like  Isaac  Hayes  . 	0.0001
The  speaker  is  plently  loud  and  the  lack  of  high  frequencies  allows  you  to  tune  into  the  tonal  range 	0.175
where  us  humans  tend  to  converse  , 	0.0001
without  having  the  voices 	0.25
washed  over  with  background  noise  . 	0.0001
The  gels  block  an  appropriate  amount  of  external  sounds 	0.0001
allowing  you  to  concentrate  on  the  discussion  at  hand  without  impeding  your  ability 	0.5
to  hear  say 	0.125
an  ambulance  while  driving  . 	0.0001
There  is  a  small  slot  on  the  gels 	0.25
that  funnels  some  external  noise  to  your  drum  , 	0.0001
while  the  rest  of  the  gel  fits  snug  to  the  ear 	0.75
blocking  out  other  stray  noise  paths  . 	0.0001
I  `  ve  asked  people 	0.0001
how  I  sound 	0.0001
and  thus  far  the  feedback  has  been  positive  , 	0.375
my  voice  comes  through  loud  and  clear  despite  the  boom  's  apparent  lack  of  length  , 	0.3333333333333333
reinforcing  my  belief 	0.125
that  size  DOES  N'T  matter  . 	0.125
In  fact  , 	0.0001
I  have  found  the  mic  to  be  very  sensitive  to  even  small  sounds  . 	0.21875

Yes  ,  the  mic  is  that  sensitive  . 	0.25
Even  while  driving  they  could  hear 	0.125
when  I  shifted  gears  . 	0.0001
Not  that  it  's  obtrusive  to  the  other  person  on  the  phone  , 	0.0001
it  's  just  good  to  be  aware 	0.5

Personally  ,  I  did  n't  like  Tazo  's  Red  Bush  Tea  very  much  . 	0.1875
I  `  ve  had  three  different  kinds  of  roiboos  teas  so  far  and  this  was  my  least  favorite  . 	0.4375
It  seems  like  the  flavor  of  roiboos 	0.0001
itself  is  pretty  mild  , 	0.1875
and  in  the  case  of  Tazo  's  tea  ,  the  flavors 	0.0001
they  add  completely  overwhelm  it  . 	0.5
I  found  that  I  had  to  remove  the  tea  bag  very 	0.25
quickly  lest  the  cup  become  overwhelmingly  lemony  and  acidic  . 	0.0001
Perhaps  other  pallettes  will  appreciate  the  strength  of  those  flavors  . 	0.25
Personally  , 	0.0001
I  could  n't  wait  to  finish  off  the  box  so  that  I  could  find  a  better  flavor  . 	0.875
The  other  roiboos  teas  I  have  tried  have  had  a  milder  mix  of  flavors  ,  to  a  much  better  overall  effect  . 	0.35
My  personal  choice  right  now  is  Trader  Joe  's  Orange  Spice  Roiboos  , 	0.25
which  apparently  can  be  bought  in  some  , 	0.375
but  not  all  of  their  stores  . 	0.0001
The  orange  flavor  is  much  less  up 	0.1875
front  than  the  lemon  &  citrus  flavors  in  the  tazo  tea  ,  and  the  overall  effect  of  the  other  spices  is  very  nice  . 	0.4583333333333333
The  tea  smells  a  lot  like  other  spiced  foods 	0.0001
-LRB-  pumpkin  pie  comes  to  mind  -RRB- 	0.0001
and  is  very  nice  on  a  gloomy  afternoon  . 	0.4583333333333333
Also  unlike  the  Tazo  version  ,  the  flavor  of  this  tea  gets  nicer  and  richer  the  longer  you  let  the  tea  bag  steep  , 	0.125
although  even  just  pouring  the  water  over  the  bag 	0.125
and  leaving  it  for  a  few  seconds  is  usually  enough  for  a  nice  cup  . 	0.4166666666666667
Admittedly  , 	0.0001
there  are  a  lot  of  other  roiboos  teas  I  have  not  tried  , 	0.25
but  this  one  has  been  a  hit  with  me 	0.25
because  of  its  good  flavor  and  local  availability  . 	0.625
Keep  in  mind  this  is  not  the  opinion  of  a  tea  expert  , 	0.1875
and  I  have  never  had  roiboos  tea  in  Africa  so  I  do  n't  know  what  it  is  supposed  to  taste  like  in  its  authentic  presentation  . 	0.21875
Just  my  personal  taste 	0.0001
