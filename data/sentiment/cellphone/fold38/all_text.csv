18_cell_neg_1	I ` ve previously had subscription cell phone services with a variety of providers ,
18_cell_neg_2	but found
18_cell_neg_3	I rarely used the number of minutes
18_cell_neg_4	I was paying for .
18_cell_neg_5	A prepaid phone service seemed like the way to go ,
18_cell_neg_6	and STI Mobile sounded like a good alternative
18_cell_neg_7	because the price was competitive
18_cell_neg_8	and minutes do n't expire .
18_cell_neg_9	I signed up
18_cell_neg_10	and shortly after received my Samsung phone .
18_cell_neg_11	It arrived , however ,
18_cell_neg_12	defective - the port for recharging the phone was damaged .
18_cell_neg_13	Per the STI Mobile web site ,
18_cell_neg_14	I contacted
18_cell_neg_15	them within 14 days to arrange for a replacement phone .
18_cell_neg_16	This resulted in a number of email exchanges with customer service .
18_cell_neg_17	In the first one , the rep told me
18_cell_neg_18	that I was mistaken ,
18_cell_neg_19	and must have been sent the wrong charger .
18_cell_neg_20	No offer was made to replace the charger , strangely ,
18_cell_neg_21	which was included as part of the package deal .
18_cell_neg_22	After additional emails
18_cell_neg_23	where I reassured her
18_cell_neg_24	that I did in fact have the right charger
18_cell_neg_25	-LRB- I took the phone in to a local merchant ,
18_cell_neg_26	who showed me the charger
18_cell_neg_27	I was shipped
18_cell_neg_28	worked with an identical model phone -
18_cell_neg_29	it was the port on the shipped phone
18_cell_neg_30	that was defective -RRB- .
18_cell_neg_31	At this point , the rep apologized and told me
18_cell_neg_32	I would have to contact Samsung for a replacement phone !
18_cell_neg_33	This entire process took several weeks .
18_cell_neg_34	In short ,
18_cell_neg_35	I guess you get
18_cell_neg_36	what you pay for .
18_cell_neg_37	If I had been shipped a working phone STI Mobile probably would have met my needs ,
18_cell_neg_38	but I was turned off by the poor customer service
18_cell_neg_39	and have since found another prepaid phone provider
