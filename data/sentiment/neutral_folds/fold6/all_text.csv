18_cell_neg_1	 I  `  ve  previously  had  subscription  cell  phone  services  with  a  variety  of  providers  , 
18_cell_neg_2	 but  found 
18_cell_neg_3	 I  rarely  used  the  number  of  minutes 
18_cell_neg_4	 I  was  paying  for  . 
18_cell_neg_5	 A  prepaid  phone  service  seemed  like  the  way  to  go  , 
18_cell_neg_6	 and  STI  Mobile  sounded  like  a  good  alternative 
18_cell_neg_7	 because  the  price  was  competitive 
18_cell_neg_8	 and  minutes  do  n't  expire  . 
18_cell_neg_9	 I  signed  up 
18_cell_neg_10	 and  shortly  after  received  my  Samsung  phone  . 
18_cell_neg_11	 It  arrived  ,  however  , 
18_cell_neg_12	 defective  -  the  port  for  recharging  the  phone  was  damaged  . 
18_cell_neg_13	 Per  the  STI  Mobile  web  site  , 
18_cell_neg_14	 I  contacted 
18_cell_neg_15	 them  within  14  days  to  arrange  for  a  replacement  phone  . 
18_cell_neg_16	 This  resulted  in  a  number  of  email  exchanges  with  customer  service  . 
18_cell_neg_17	 In  the  first  one  ,  the  rep  told  me 
18_cell_neg_18	 that  I  was  mistaken  , 
18_cell_neg_19	 and  must  have  been  sent  the  wrong  charger  . 
18_cell_neg_20	 No  offer  was  made  to  replace  the  charger  ,  strangely  , 
18_cell_neg_21	 which  was  included  as  part  of  the  package  deal  . 
18_cell_neg_22	 After  additional  emails 
18_cell_neg_23	 where  I  reassured  her 
18_cell_neg_24	 that  I  did  in  fact  have  the  right  charger 
18_cell_neg_25	 -LRB-  I  took  the  phone  in  to  a  local  merchant  , 
18_cell_neg_26	 who  showed  me  the  charger 
18_cell_neg_27	 I  was  shipped 
18_cell_neg_28	 worked  with  an  identical  model  phone  - 
18_cell_neg_29	 it  was  the  port  on  the  shipped  phone 
18_cell_neg_30	 that  was  defective  -RRB-  . 
18_cell_neg_31	 At  this  point  ,  the  rep  apologized  and  told  me 
18_cell_neg_32	 I  would  have  to  contact  Samsung  for  a  replacement  phone  ! 
18_cell_neg_33	 This  entire  process  took  several  weeks  . 
18_cell_neg_34	 In  short  , 
18_cell_neg_35	 I  guess  you  get 
18_cell_neg_36	 what  you  pay  for  . 
18_cell_neg_37	 If  I  had  been  shipped  a  working  phone  STI  Mobile  probably  would  have  met  my  needs  , 
18_cell_neg_38	 but  I  was  turned  off  by  the  poor  customer  service 
18_cell_neg_39	 and  have  since  found  another  prepaid  phone  provider 
20_cell_neg_1	 After  reading  the  numerous  positive  reviews  for  this  phone  , 
20_cell_neg_2	 I  purchased  . 
20_cell_neg_3	 Here  are  the  main  issues  I  have  found  with  this  phone  : 
20_cell_neg_4	 1  -RRB-  The  buttons  are  too  small  , 
20_cell_neg_5	 particularly  the  main  control  button  . 
20_cell_neg_6	 You  have  to  used  the  side  of  your  fingers 
20_cell_neg_7	 to  ensure 
20_cell_neg_8	 that  you  do  not  hit  too  buttons  at  the  same  time  . 
20_cell_neg_9	 And  ,  believe 
20_cell_neg_10	 me  , 
20_cell_neg_11	 I  do  not  have  very  large  hands  . 
20_cell_neg_12	 2  -RRB-  If  you  have  quite  a  few  contacts  in  your  phone  , 
20_cell_neg_13	 you  will  be  irritated  by  the  delay 
20_cell_neg_14	 when  you  scroll  down  quickly  to  select  a  contact  . 
20_cell_neg_15	 You  will  notice  that  if  you  are  not  careful  , 
20_cell_neg_16	 you  will  dial  the  wrong  contact  due 
20_cell_neg_17	 to  the  delay 
20_cell_neg_18	 when  scrolling  and  selecting  quickly  ,  so  if  this  is  you  ,  be  aware  . 
20_cell_neg_19	 3  -RRB-  You 
20_cell_neg_20	 must  open  the  cover 
20_cell_neg_21	 and  look  inside  to  see  if  you  have  missed  a  call  or  have  a  message  . 
20_cell_neg_22	 VERY  INCONVENIENT  !  ! 
20_cell_neg_23	 There  is  no  indication  to  show  this  on  the  top  screen  ,  only  the  inside  screen  . 
20_cell_neg_24	 4  -RRB-  On  occasion  ,  the  display  on  the  outside  of  the  phone  stops 
20_cell_neg_25	 working  entirely  . 
20_cell_neg_26	 What  you  just  need  to  do  is  power  the  phone  down 
20_cell_neg_27	 and  they  back  up  again  . 
20_cell_neg_28	 Not  optimal  , 
20_cell_neg_29	 and  I  probably  just  got  a  bad  phone  , 
20_cell_neg_30	 but  I  am  just  waiting  for  the  situation  to  get  more  frequent  , 
20_cell_neg_31	 so  I  can  then  deal  with  the  likely  nightmare  of  having  to  get  a  replacement  phone  from  Motorola  . 
20_cell_neg_32	 NOTE  : 
20_cell_neg_33	 I  have  no  personal  vendetta  against  Motorola  , 
20_cell_neg_34	 but  wanted  to  provide  some  real  feedback  rather  than  all  just  rosey  stuff 
20_cell_neg_35	 I  bought  into  before  purchasing 
4_cell_pos_1	 There  are  many  good  reviews  on  8525  positive  features  and  most  are  fairly  accurate  . 
4_cell_pos_2	 Lots  of  good  features  in  the  8525  . 
4_cell_pos_3	 My  intent  is  to  document  some 
4_cell_pos_4	 of  the  shortcomings  of  the  8525 
4_cell_pos_5	 and  Windows  Mobile  OS  in  the  hope  that  MS  and  HTC  will  heed  and  correct  in  the  future  . 
4_cell_pos_6	 I  am  a  business  user 
4_cell_pos_7	 who  wanted  to  combine  my  HP  IPAQ  1945  and  my  Motorola  V550  Cell  phone  into  one  device  . 
4_cell_pos_8	 I  use  a  Motorola  H700  headset  with  my  old  devices  and  the  8525  . 
4_cell_pos_9	 My  overall  assessment  is  ; 
4_cell_pos_10	 Replacing  my  two  3  year 
4_cell_pos_11	 old  devices  resulted  in  me  accepting  some  compromises 
4_cell_pos_12	 that  I  do  n't  think  are  necessary  in  terms  of  functionality  and  ease  of  use  . 
4_cell_pos_13	 All  the  features  I  describe  below  were  in  the  earlier  Windows  Mobile  OS 
4_cell_pos_14	 used  by  my  IPAQ  1945  or  my  Motorola  flip  phone  . 
4_cell_pos_15	 If  readers  find  that  there  is  a  way  to  perform  any  of  the  deficiencies 
4_cell_pos_16	 I  describe  please  let  me  know  . 
4_cell_pos_17	 My  suggestions  in  rough  order  of  priority  : 
4_cell_pos_18	 1  -RRB-  Blue  tooth  headsets  . 
4_cell_pos_19	 Blue  tooth  audio  should  always  come  through  the  blue  tooth  headset  regardless  of  the  PDA  volume  setting  . 
4_cell_pos_20	 To  hear  my  voice  commands  repeated  , 
4_cell_pos_21	 I  have  to  turn  on  the  annoying  sound  of  the  PDA  , 
4_cell_pos_22	 so  when  I  voice  dial  via  my  Blue  tooth  headset  , 
4_cell_pos_23	 I  can  hear  my  voice  commands 
4_cell_pos_24	 repeated  back  . 
4_cell_pos_25	 I  am 
4_cell_pos_26	 referring  to  the  standard  voice  dial 
4_cell_pos_27	 that  comes  with  the  8525  . 
4_cell_pos_28	 One  quick  solution  would  be  to  tie  BT  headset  to  the  phone  volume  setting  rather  than  the  PDA  . 
4_cell_pos_29	 Even  nicer  would  be  an  upgrade 
4_cell_pos_30	" ""that  allows  full  audio  with  the  """"  VoiceCommand  """"  software"" "
4_cell_pos_31	 -LRB-  this  is  documented  in  many  other  reviews  -RRB-  . 
4_cell_pos_32	 Another  nice  feature  of  my  Motorola  cell  phone  was  as  soon  as  the  BT  was  detected  the  phone  volume 
4_cell_pos_33	 changed  from  vibrate 
4_cell_pos_34	 to  audio  if  it  was  set  to  vibrate  . 
4_cell_pos_35	 It  changed  back  to  the  original  audio 
4_cell_pos_36	 setting  after  turning  off  the  BT  headset  . 
4_cell_pos_37	 1a  -RRB-  If  I  request  voice  dial  via  my  blue  tooth  headset  the  screen  should  ALWAYS  display  the  voice  dial  page  . 
4_cell_pos_38	" ""Instead  the  initial  """"  Owner  Info  """"  page  stays  up"" "
4_cell_pos_39	 and  you  ca  n't  see  the  name  on  the  screen  unless  you  reach  down 
4_cell_pos_40	 and  tap  the  screen  . 
4_cell_pos_41	 Not  desirable 
4_cell_pos_42	 when  driving  . 
4_cell_pos_43	 If  you  did  n't  set  the  PDA  to  its  annoying  noise  level  you  ca  n't  hear  the  name 
4_cell_pos_44	 you  requested 
4_cell_pos_45	 either  . 
4_cell_pos_46	 2  -RRB-  Need 
4_cell_pos_47	 to  be  able  to  control  the  PDA  and  phone  volume  independently  for  Audio  ,  Vibrate  or  OFF  . 
4_cell_pos_48	 For  example  need  to  be  able  to  tie  turn  up  the  phone  volume  while  keeping  the  PDA  volume  setting  on  OFF  or  vibrate  . 
4_cell_pos_49	 3  -RRB-  Need 
4_cell_pos_50	 to  be  able 
4_cell_pos_51	 to  program  how  long  the  display  stays  on  . 
4_cell_pos_52	 I  am  constantly  groping  to  find  the  power  button  on  the  side  to  keep  the  display  on  as  it  turns  off 
4_cell_pos_53	 when  I  need 
4_cell_pos_54	 to  see  something  . 
4_cell_pos_55	 4  -RRB-  I  would  buy  a  non  Bluetooth  headset  if  one  was  available  for  long  drives 
4_cell_pos_56	 when  my  BT  headset  battery  is  dead  . 
4_cell_pos_57	 Only  solution  I  see  is  the  8525  stereo  headphones  and  turning  on  the  speaker 
4_cell_pos_58	 which  is  a  little  noisy  for  listeners 
4_cell_pos_59	 while  driving  on  the  freeway  . 
4_cell_pos_60	 5  -RRB- 
4_cell_pos_61	 Provide  a  built  in  way  to  make  the  PTT  and  Comm  Manager  , 
4_cell_pos_62	 and  IE  Quick  key  buttons  programmable  . 
4_cell_pos_63	 I  would  use  them  for  many  other  functions  ;  such  as  PTT  bringing  up  the  volume  control 
4_cell_pos_64	 so  I  can  change  it  from  vibrate  to  audio  to  speaker 
4_cell_pos_65	 -LRB-  need  to  be  able  to  select  speaker  here  see  below  -RRB-  . 
4_cell_pos_66	 6  -RRB-  Give  me  a  way  to  press  an  external  button  to  toggle  between  speaker  on 
4_cell_pos_67	 and  off  . 
4_cell_pos_68	 I  ca  n't  easily  push  the  speaker  icon  with  my  fingers  . 
4_cell_pos_69	 Suggestion  . 
4_cell_pos_70	 Add  a  radio  button  on  the  volume  control 
4_cell_pos_71	 that  allows  you  to  select  speaker  phone  . 
4_cell_pos_72	 Yes  you  can  select  the  phone  speaker  soft  button  , 
4_cell_pos_73	 but  often  the  display  has  gone  blank 
4_cell_pos_74	 and  the  keypad  is  showing  . 
4_cell_pos_75	 Turning  speaker  on\/off  should  be  easier  . 
4_cell_pos_76	 7  -RRB-  Provide  option  to  save  email  attachments  to  storage  card  . 
4_cell_pos_77	 That  was  on  my  IPAQ  Windows  OS 
4_cell_pos_78	 and  allowed  me  to  capture  lots  of  attachments  without  running  out  of  memory  . 
4_cell_pos_79	 8  -RRB-  Remember 
4_cell_pos_80	 the  Filter 
4_cell_pos_81	setting
4_cell_pos_82	 I  selected  for  Tasks  . 
4_cell_pos_83	 If  I  have  filtered  by  a  task  category 
4_cell_pos_84	 during  that  session  remember  the  filter 
4_cell_pos_85	 I  selected  . 
4_cell_pos_86	 Currently  I  have  so  many  tasks 
4_cell_pos_87	 there  is  a  5  second  delay  to  bring  them  all  up 
4_cell_pos_88	 9  -RRB-  Give  me  a  way  to  turn  off  have  the  Internet  browser 
4_cell_pos_89	 Quick  Key 
4_cell_pos_90	 -LRB-  or  make  this  button  programmable  -RRB- 
4_cell_pos_91	I
4_cell_pos_92	 am  always  having  to  close  the  browser 
4_cell_pos_93	 because  it  gets  hit\/selected 
4_cell_pos_94	 10  -RRB-  Let 
4_cell_pos_95	 me  Edit\/Paste  with  one  step  for  notes  ,  word  ,  task  notes  etc  . 
4_cell_pos_96	" ""The  IPAQ  has  """"  Edit  """""" "
4_cell_pos_97	 at  the  bottom  . 
4_cell_pos_98	 With  8525  OS 
4_cell_pos_99	 you  must  select  Menu  , 
4_cell_pos_100	 then  Edit  , 
4_cell_pos_101	 then  Copy  . 
4_cell_pos_102	 Keep  Edit  on  the  bottom  . 
4_cell_pos_103	 Question  : 
4_cell_pos_104	 is  there  a  key  on  the  keypad  to  select  CNTRL  C  for  copy  like  what  is  done  on  a  PC 
4_cell_pos_105	 -LRB-  the  letters  are  underlined  in  the  menu  ,  but  I  do  n't  see  a  CNTRL  key  on  the  keypad  ? 
4_cell_pos_106	 11  -RRB-  Allow  the  trackwheel  to  scroll  up 
4_cell_pos_107	 to  the  icons  on  the  top 
4_cell_pos_108	 and  then  use  the  nav  button  to  move  across  the  icons 
4_cell_pos_109	 -LRB-  might  be  the  way 
4_cell_pos_110	 to  allow  an  external  way 
4_cell_pos_111	 to  set  audio  volume  -RRB- 
4_cell_pos_112	 12  -RRB-  If  I  power  off  the  device  have  it  remember  my  input  selection  . 
4_cell_pos_113	 For  example 
4_cell_pos_114	" ""I  select  """"  Letter  Recognizer  """"  ."" "
4_cell_pos_115	 But  I  must  reset  each  time  I  power  8525  off  . 
5_cell_pos_1	 Well  I  read  through  just  about  every  review  prior  to  purchasing  this  phone 
5_cell_pos_2	 and  was  almost  thinking  twice  about  it 
5_cell_pos_3	 after  reading  some  of  the  reviews  here  , 
5_cell_pos_4	 but  I  decided  to  take  the  plunge 
5_cell_pos_5	 and  go  for  it  . 
5_cell_pos_6	 Well  I  'm  glad 
5_cell_pos_7	 I  did  . 
5_cell_pos_8	 All  I  can  say  is  this  phone 
5_cell_pos_9	 has  been  a  pleasure 
5_cell_pos_10	 to  use  from  the  get-go  . 
5_cell_pos_11	 It  has  its  flaws 
5_cell_pos_12	 but  what  phone  does  n't  ? 
5_cell_pos_13	 The  question  is  whether  you  `  re  going  go  flip  out  over  an  alarm  clock  or  volume  strip  or  is  it  a  trivial  issue  for  you  . 
5_cell_pos_14	 Most  of  the  gripes  others  have  had  just  seem  little  to  me  . 
5_cell_pos_15	 Let  's  talk  about  the  pros  and  cons  : 
5_cell_pos_16	 Pros  : 
5_cell_pos_17	 1  .  Call  quality  is  excellent  . 
5_cell_pos_18	 No  static 
5_cell_pos_19	 what  so  ever  . 
5_cell_pos_20	 No  dropped  calls  . 
5_cell_pos_21	 My  area  has  good  T-mobile  coverage 
5_cell_pos_22	 so  I  ca  n't  complain  . 
5_cell_pos_23	 As  a  phone 
5_cell_pos_24	 it  does 
5_cell_pos_25	 what  it  's  supposed  to  do  . 
5_cell_pos_26	 Make  good  quality  calls  . 
5_cell_pos_27	 It  also  pairs  with  my  bluetooth  headset 
5_cell_pos_28	 -LRB-  Plantronics  510  -RRB- 
5_cell_pos_29	 really  well  . 
5_cell_pos_30	 Speaker  phone  is  of  good  quality  too  . 
5_cell_pos_31	 2  .  Internet  works  great  . 
5_cell_pos_32	 I  have  the  $  5.99  plan 
5_cell_pos_33	 and  yes  EDGE  is  n't  the  fastest 
5_cell_pos_34	 but  it  gets  the  job 
5_cell_pos_35	 done  . 
5_cell_pos_36	 It  does  n't  matter 
5_cell_pos_37	 where  I  'm  at  I  can  check  my  email  , 
5_cell_pos_38	 finds  restaurants  or  directions  ,  or  just  surf  the  web 
5_cell_pos_39	 when  I  'm  bored  . 
5_cell_pos_40	 It  really  came  in  handy 
5_cell_pos_41	 when  I  was  out  on  vacation 
5_cell_pos_42	 and  lost  . 
5_cell_pos_43	 WiFi  works  well  too  . 
5_cell_pos_44	 Did  n't  want  to  fork  out  the  money  for  hotspots  though  . 
5_cell_pos_45	 3  .  The  camera  at  1.3  megapixels  is  decent  quality  . 
5_cell_pos_46	 No  it  's  not  going  to  replace  my  regular  camera 
5_cell_pos_47	 but  I  found  it  really  handy 
5_cell_pos_48	 when  I  forgot  to  take  my  camera  to  my  friend  's  wedding  , 
5_cell_pos_49	 but  was  still  able  to  take  quality  pictures  . 
5_cell_pos_50	 I  have  n't  tried  videos  yet  though  . 
5_cell_pos_51	 4  . 
5_cell_pos_52	 Mp3\/Video  player  : 
5_cell_pos_53	 Now  the  speakers  on  this  phone  are  n't  the  greatest  so  I  would  n't  use  them  for  listening  to  music 
5_cell_pos_54	 but  when  plugged  into  a  headset 
5_cell_pos_55	 it  sounds  pretty  good  . 
5_cell_pos_56	 I  bought 
5_cell_pos_57	 a  2GB  microSD  card  bought  here  at  Amazon 
5_cell_pos_58	 and  now  I  can  hold  a  ton  music  and  movies  . 
5_cell_pos_59	 Videos  looks  pretty  nice 
5_cell_pos_60	 I  'd  have  to  admit  . 
5_cell_pos_61	 This  thing  is  my  travelinig  entertainment  center  . 
5_cell_pos_62	 I  even  found  a  way  to  play  original  nintendo  games  on  this  thing 
5_cell_pos_63	 and  have  been  trying  Mike  Tyson  's  Punchout  like  back  in  the  old  days  . 
5_cell_pos_64	 5  .  Calendar\/schedule  : 
5_cell_pos_65	 I  had  a  PDA 
5_cell_pos_66	 but  for  some  reason 
5_cell_pos_67	 I  'm  more  compelled  to  actually  use  my  calendar 
5_cell_pos_68	 and  keep  my  schedule  on  this  thing 
5_cell_pos_69	 than  I  did  with  my  Pocket  PC  . 
5_cell_pos_70	 Probably  because  of  convenience  reasons  . 
5_cell_pos_71	 6  .  Smartphone  applications  : 
5_cell_pos_72	 I  'm  in  the  medical  field 
5_cell_pos_73	 and  I  keep  all  my  medical  applications  on  this  phone  . 
5_cell_pos_74	 I  can  quickly  look  up  drug  references  or  research  diseases  . 
5_cell_pos_75	 I  really  thought  I  'd  need  a  touchscreen 
5_cell_pos_76	 in  order  to  better  navigate  these  programs 
5_cell_pos_77	 and  while  it  might  be  slightly  easier  with  a  stylus  , 
5_cell_pos_78	 I  do  n't  find  that  it  's  all  that 
5_cell_pos_79	necessary
5_cell_pos_80	 and  still  navigate  pretty  well  . 
5_cell_pos_81	 I  just  wish  the  processor  were  slightly  faster  for  some  of  these  apps  , 
5_cell_pos_82	 but  it  's  more  than  adequate  . 
5_cell_pos_83	 And  I  'm  not  sure 
5_cell_pos_84	 why  people  do  n't  think 
5_cell_pos_85	 there  are  a  lot  of  programs  for  the  smartphone  . 
5_cell_pos_86	 Programs  written  for  WM5  are  compatable  with  PPC  as  well  as  smartphones  equally  . 
5_cell_pos_87	 -LRB-  .  .  .  -RRB-  . 
5_cell_pos_88	 7  .  Appearance  : 
5_cell_pos_89	 Everyone  who  sees  this  phone  absolutely  loves  its  looks 
5_cell_pos_90	 and  so  do  I  . 
5_cell_pos_91	 It  looks  great 
5_cell_pos_92	 and  feels  great  . 
5_cell_pos_93	 I  saw  this  side  by  side  with  the  Motorola  Q 
5_cell_pos_94	 and  the  Q  just  looked  so  much  bulkier  and  .  .  .  well  .  .  .  not 
5_cell_pos_95	 as  nice  . 
5_cell_pos_96	 The  rubber  backing  feels  awesome  . 
5_cell_pos_97	 8  . 
5_cell_pos_98	 Battery  : 
5_cell_pos_99	 For  all 
5_cell_pos_100	 that  I  use  this  phone 
5_cell_pos_101	 for  it  makes  it  through  the  day  with  plenty  battery  to  spare 
5_cell_pos_102	 which  is  all 
5_cell_pos_103	 I  can  really  ask  for  . 
5_cell_pos_104	 I  would  n't  go  2  days  without  charging  the  battery  though  . 
5_cell_pos_105	 You  should  charge  it  every  night  . 
5_cell_pos_106	 Cons  : 
5_cell_pos_107	 1  . 
5_cell_pos_108	 Windows  Mobile  5  : 
5_cell_pos_109	 Mighty  Microsoft  needs  to  write  a  cleaner  program  . 
5_cell_pos_110	 However  Windows  Mobile  6  is  on  the  way 
5_cell_pos_111	 and  will  be  free  to  download  for  T-Mobile  customer  soon 
5_cell_pos_112	 so  hopefully  that  `  ll  take  care  of  some  of  the  problems  . 
5_cell_pos_113	 I  swear  just  to  turn  on  the  bluetooth 
5_cell_pos_114	 and  pair  up  my  bluetooth  device 
5_cell_pos_115	 takes  me  a  whole  minute  just  because  of  how  hard  it  is  to  navigate  WM5  . 
5_cell_pos_116	 2  . 
5_cell_pos_117	 Volume  strip  : 
5_cell_pos_118	 Yeah  like  everyone  says 
5_cell_pos_119	 it  sucks  . 
5_cell_pos_120	 I  disabled  mine  . 
5_cell_pos_121	 Adjusting  the  volume  with  this  thing  is  tedious  at  best  . 
5_cell_pos_122	 Luckily  my  music\/video  programs  as  well  as  my  stereo  headset  allow 
5_cell_pos_123	 me  easier  ways  to  adjust  the  volume 
5_cell_pos_124	 so  it  's  not  such  an  issue  for  me  . 
5_cell_pos_125	 3  .  Alarm  clock  : 
5_cell_pos_126	 Now  I  do  n't  use  this  all  that  much 
5_cell_pos_127	 but  I  see  what  everyone  says 
5_cell_pos_128	 about  it 
5_cell_pos_129	 and  yeah  it  's  a  pretty  idiotic  written  program  . 
5_cell_pos_130	 However  rather  than  writing  half  a  page  on  how  bad  it  is  I  downloaded  a  free  one  from  the  internet 
5_cell_pos_131	 that  works  great 
5_cell_pos_132	 so  my  life  now  goes  on  . 
5_cell_pos_133	 Summary  : 
5_cell_pos_134	 So  I  use  this  device  to  make  quality  phone  calls  ,  surf  the  web  ,  check  email  ,  play  games  ,  listen  to  music  ,  watch  movies  ,  monitor  my  schedule  ,  check  my  medical  references  , 
5_cell_pos_135	 and  take  decent  quality  pictures  . 
5_cell_pos_136	 All  this  thing  needs 
5_cell_pos_137	 now  is  a  laser  beam 
5_cell_pos_138	 that  will  cut  through  metal 
5_cell_pos_139	 and  it  'd  be  the  greatest  gadget 
5_cell_pos_140	 known  to  man 
19_gourmet_neg_1	 I  love  salmon 
19_gourmet_neg_2	 and  was  very  excited  about  having  salmon  jerky  to  keep  at  the  office 
19_gourmet_neg_3	 and  take 
19_gourmet_neg_4	 camping  and  skiing  .  .  . 
19_gourmet_neg_5	 until  I  got  my  order 
19_gourmet_neg_6	 and  found  out  that 
19_gourmet_neg_7	 both  flavors  contain  MSG  , 
19_gourmet_neg_8	 which  gives  some  people 
19_gourmet_neg_9	 -LRB-  like  me  -RRB- 
19_gourmet_neg_10	 whopping  headaches  . 
19_gourmet_neg_11	 My  wife  thinks  this  jerky  is  okay  apart  from  the  processed  texture 
19_gourmet_neg_12	 and  our  dogs  love  it  , 
19_gourmet_neg_13	 but  I  wo  n't  be  trying  it  . 
19_gourmet_neg_14	 To  be  fair  , 
19_gourmet_neg_15	 you  might  like  this  product  if  you  are  n't  sensitive  to  MSG  , 
19_gourmet_neg_16	 but  the  seller  should  have  noted 
19_gourmet_neg_17	 that  it  contains  a  modern  ingredient 
19_gourmet_neg_18	" ""that  causes  adverse  reactions  in  some  people  instead  of  describing  it  as  being  """"  made  the  old  fashioned  way  .  """""" "
19_gourmet_neg_19	 On  the  plus  side  ,  shipping  was  very  quick  . 
3_gourmet_neg_1	 I  must  write  quickly  , 
3_gourmet_neg_2	 for  soon  ,  soon  ,  the  Milk  will  awake  within  me  again  . 
3_gourmet_neg_3	 And  it  will  know  , 
3_gourmet_neg_4	 but  you  will  have  been  warned  . 
3_gourmet_neg_5	 The  Milk  will  punish  me  , 
3_gourmet_neg_6	 but  it  knows 
3_gourmet_neg_7	 it  must  have  a  host  , 
3_gourmet_neg_8	 so  I  will  survive  - 
3_gourmet_neg_9	 tormented  and  trapped  within  myself  , 
3_gourmet_neg_10	 but  I  will  continue  to  exist  , 
3_gourmet_neg_11	 though  I  live  in  nightmare  now  . 
3_gourmet_neg_12	 Beware  ! 
3_gourmet_neg_13	 Beware  the  Milk  ! 
3_gourmet_neg_14	 For  the  Milk  lives  . 
3_gourmet_neg_15	 I  too  was  once  tempted  by  the  smooth  ,  sweet  creaminess  of  Tuscan  Milk  ,  1  Gallon  ,  128  Fl  Oz  . 
3_gourmet_neg_16	 I  too  read  the  odes 
3_gourmet_neg_17	 written  to  its  greatness  , 
3_gourmet_neg_18	 not  knowing 
3_gourmet_neg_19	 that  the  Milk  was  forcing  it  's  hosts 
3_gourmet_neg_20	 to  speak  of  the  goodness  of  the  Milk  that  the  Milk  might  spread  , 
3_gourmet_neg_21	 that  it  might  acquire  new  hosts  in  which  to  live  , 
3_gourmet_neg_22	 and  to  spread  , 
3_gourmet_neg_23	 to  spread  , 
3_gourmet_neg_24	 to  spread  . 
3_gourmet_neg_25	 Beware  the  sweet  seduction  of  the  Milk  ! 
3_gourmet_neg_26	 Ah  -  the  bittersweet  memories 
3_gourmet_neg_27	 of  that  first  gallon  . 
3_gourmet_neg_28	 How  smooth  ,  how  creamy  ,  how  exhilarating  ,  uplifting  ,  fulfilling  and  enlightening  ! 
3_gourmet_neg_29	 How  free  it  made  me  feel  ! 
3_gourmet_neg_30	 But  then  came  that  terrible  moment 
3_gourmet_neg_31	 when  in  my  home  town  supermarket  , 
3_gourmet_neg_32	 I  reached  for  a  gallon  of  store  brand  milk  , 
3_gourmet_neg_33	 and  felt  the  pain  . 
3_gourmet_neg_34	 Oh  ,  the  pain  the  Milk  can  give  ! 
3_gourmet_neg_35	 Equal  in  intensity  to  the  first  joy  that  the  Milk  can  give  ,  but  pain  ! 
3_gourmet_neg_36	 Terrible  pain  ! 
3_gourmet_neg_37	 Words  alone  can  not  describe  it  ! 
3_gourmet_neg_38	 And  now  , 
3_gourmet_neg_39	 I  live  in  fear  of  the  Milk  ,  a  Slave  to  the  joy 
3_gourmet_neg_40	 and  the  pain 
3_gourmet_neg_41	 it  can  give  . 
3_gourmet_neg_42	 Oh  ,  the  shame 
3_gourmet_neg_43	 I  feel 
3_gourmet_neg_44	 that  I  must  come  to  the  Milk  like  a  supplicant  , 
3_gourmet_neg_45	 begging  for  the  pleasure 
3_gourmet_neg_46	 it  can  give  . 
3_gourmet_neg_47	 And  the  cowardice  that  I  feel  , 
3_gourmet_neg_48	knowing
3_gourmet_neg_49	 that  I  can  not  face  the  pain  it  can  inflict  . 
3_gourmet_neg_50	 Beware  ! 
3_gourmet_neg_51	 Do  not  let  this  be  your  fate  ! 
3_gourmet_neg_52	 And  now  , 
3_gourmet_neg_53	 I  must  go  .  .  . 
3_gourmet_neg_54	 the  Milk  stirs  inside  me  , 
3_gourmet_neg_55	 and  it  will  be  angry  . 
3_gourmet_neg_56	 But  perhaps  ,  perhaps  , 
3_gourmet_neg_57	 it  is  not  too  late  for  you  .  .  .

7_gourmet_pos_45	\*\*\*\*
12_kitchen_neg_1	 I  `  ve  bought  a  number  of  Oxo  kitchen  accessories  ,  and  found  them  to  be  sturdy  ,  remarkably  well  designed  , 
12_kitchen_neg_2	 and  easy  to  use  . 
12_kitchen_neg_3	 Unfortunately  ,  this  timer  is  an  exception  . 
12_kitchen_neg_4	 It  has  the  usual  features  typical  of  timers  at  this  price  point  : 
12_kitchen_neg_5	 clock  plus  timer  ,  ten  number  keys  for  input  ,  memory  ,  etc  . 
12_kitchen_neg_6	 But  instead  of  being  flat  with  a  magnet  on  the  back 
12_kitchen_neg_7	 so  it  can  fall  off  the  refrigerator  like  other  timers  , 
12_kitchen_neg_8	 it  's  round  like  a  traditional  wind-up  kitchen  timer  . 
12_kitchen_neg_9	 It  's  solid-feeling 
12_kitchen_neg_10	 and  has  nice  non-skid  feet  on  the  bottom  . 
12_kitchen_neg_11	 The  problem  is  the  display  . 
12_kitchen_neg_12	 It  's  horrible  . 
12_kitchen_neg_13	 For  three  reasons  : 
12_kitchen_neg_14	 First  ,  the  numbers  are  small  --  smaller  than  any  other  timer 
12_kitchen_neg_15	 I  `  ve  seen  . 
12_kitchen_neg_16	" ""They  `  re  about  1\/4  """"  high  ,"" "
12_kitchen_neg_17	 half  or  less  the  size  of  those  on  comparable  timers  . 
12_kitchen_neg_18	" ""Second  ,  the  numbers  are  recessed  1\/8  """"  or  more  beneath  a  clear  plastic  cover  ,  not  on  the  surface"" "
12_kitchen_neg_19	 --  it  's  dark  in  there  and  feels  like  looking  down  a  well  . 
12_kitchen_neg_20	 It  desperately  needs  a  backlight  , 
12_kitchen_neg_21	 but  there  is  none  . 
12_kitchen_neg_22	 Unless  the  light  source  is  shining  directly  into  the  display  , 
12_kitchen_neg_23	 there  's  a  large  dark  shadow 
12_kitchen_neg_24	 covering  part  of  the  numbers  . 
12_kitchen_neg_25	 But  that  causes  the  third  problem  : 
12_kitchen_neg_26	 The  clear  plastic  cover  over  the  numbers  is  both  curved  and  highly  reflective  , 
12_kitchen_neg_27	 and  it  's  virtually  impossible  to  arrange  things  so  that  there  is  n't  a  reflection 
12_kitchen_neg_28	 shining  back  into  your  eyes  . 
12_kitchen_neg_29	 The  bottom  line  is  that  I  have  to  fiddle  around  to  get  the  timer  ,  the  light  source  ,  and  myself  into  a  position 
12_kitchen_neg_30	 where  I  can  read  the  small  ,  dark  ,  shadowed  , 
12_kitchen_neg_31	 and  reflective  display  . 
12_kitchen_neg_32	 Not  what  I  need 
12_kitchen_neg_33	 when  I  'm  trying  to  cook  . 
12_kitchen_neg_34	 It  's  just  not  worth  it  . 
12_kitchen_neg_35	 Since  I  have  several  other  timers  with  displays 
12_kitchen_neg_36	 I  do  n't  have  to  strain  to  read  , 
12_kitchen_neg_37	 I  use  this  one  as  a  paperweight  . 
12_kitchen_neg_38	 I  'd  have  to  say 
12_kitchen_neg_39	 it  works  very  well  . 
12_kitchen_neg_40	 I  just  do  n't  understand 
12_kitchen_neg_41	 how  Oxo  managed  to  let  such  a  flawed  design  out  the  door 
7_kitchen_neg_1	 When  I  ordered  this  product  , 
7_kitchen_neg_2	 it  had  a  4  star  average  rating  - 
7_kitchen_neg_3	 how  that  happened  is  beyond  me  . 
7_kitchen_neg_4	 Were  a  zero  star  rating  available  ,  this  product  would  n't  even  deserve  the  string  of  uncolored  stars  ! 
7_kitchen_neg_5	 I  purchased 
7_kitchen_neg_6	 it  , 
7_kitchen_neg_7	thinking
7_kitchen_neg_8	" ""it  would  certainly  do  better  than  the  plastic  """"  freebie  """"  grinder"" "
7_kitchen_neg_9	 that  came  with  some  peppercorns  about  a  year  ago  . 
7_kitchen_neg_10	 After  many  refills  , 
7_kitchen_neg_11	 that  all-plastic  grinder  has  finially  started  to  wear  out 
7_kitchen_neg_12	 and  peppercorns  get 
7_kitchen_neg_13	" ""stuck  in  the  """"  gears  """"  ,  the  grinder  has  started  to  squeak  and  spits  out  chunks  of  pepper  ."" "
7_kitchen_neg_14	 So  I  order  this  one  --  it  's  attractive  ,  low\/mid  priced 
7_kitchen_neg_15	 and  offers  a  warranty  against  wearing  out  -- 
7_kitchen_neg_16	 and  guess  what  ? 
7_kitchen_neg_17	 I  'm  still  using  the  plastic  worn-out  grinder  ! 
7_kitchen_neg_18	 This  MIU  grinder  was  a  total  waste  of  money  and  I  just  ca  n't  bear  to  listen  to  it  squeal 
7_kitchen_neg_19	 when  I  attempt 
7_kitchen_neg_20	 to  use  it  . 
7_kitchen_neg_21	 Its  adjustement  is  loose  enough  , 
7_kitchen_neg_22	 that  's  not  the  problem  . 
7_kitchen_neg_23	 What  good  's  a  lifetime  warranty  against  wearing  out  if  I  'm  not  going  to  use  the  grinder  at  all  ? 
7_kitchen_neg_24	 Now  I  'm  stuck  with  it  , 
7_kitchen_neg_25	 unless  I  want  to  pay  to  ship  it  back 
7_kitchen_neg_26	 and  lose  free  shipping  discount  on  the  original  order  ,  so  basically  ,  I  may  could  get  a  few  bucks  back  . 
7_kitchen_neg_27	 Which  is  probably  what  I  `  ll  do 
7_kitchen_neg_28	 because  this  grinder  is  n't  worth  2  cents  ! 
7_kitchen_neg_29	 I  would  n't  even  give  the  thing  away  . 
7_kitchen_neg_30	 Maybe  pepper  grinders  are  one  of  those  things  you  just  need  to  feel  and  buy  in  person  . 
7_kitchen_neg_31	 I  `  ll  certainly  not  purchase  another  one  online  . 
7_kitchen_neg_32	 If  you  like  the  sound  of  fingernails 
7_kitchen_neg_33	 scratching  a  chalkboard  ,  buy  this  grinder  . 
7_kitchen_neg_34	 Buy  a  second  one  for  your  salt 
7_kitchen_neg_35	 while  you  `  re  at  it  . 
7_kitchen_neg_36	 You  `  ll  love  'em  ! 
7_kitchen_neg_37	 -LRB-  Update  1  month  later  -  I  tried 
7_kitchen_neg_38	 to  give  this  thing  a  chance 
7_kitchen_neg_39	 and  the  god-awful  squealing  is  becoming  less  consistent  . 
7_kitchen_neg_40	 Which  might  be  even  worse  , 
7_kitchen_neg_41	 as  it  now  takes  me  by  surprise  as  it  lets  out  a  high-pitched  jag  every  so  often  . 
7_kitchen_neg_42	 It  's  gotten  quite  worse  ,  however  , 
7_kitchen_neg_43	 with  spitting  out  various  sized  chunks  of  peppercorn  .  .  . 
7_kitchen_neg_44	 from  fine 
7_kitchen_neg_45	 grind  to  quarter-corn  sized  pieces 
7_kitchen_neg_46	 in  a  few  turns  . 
7_kitchen_neg_47	 Not  recommended  at  all  . 
7_kitchen_neg_48	 I  might  try  switching  it  over  to  salt  ,  maybe  it  can  handle  that  better  . 
11_kitchen_pos_1	 I  normally  do  n't  write  reviews  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_2	 but  after  owning  several  toasters  in  the  past  , 
11_kitchen_pos_3	 and  being  very  disappointed  , 
11_kitchen_pos_4	 I  just  had  to  write  about  this  one  . 
11_kitchen_pos_5	 I  owned  an  old  Toastmaster  4  slice  toaster  for  about  20  years  . 
11_kitchen_pos_6	 It  never  did  brown  evenly  ,  but  was  a  workhorse 
11_kitchen_pos_7	 until  finally  the  bread  crumb  tray  broke  . 
11_kitchen_pos_8	 Got  my  money  's  worth  . 
11_kitchen_pos_9	 I  have  done  a  lot  of  research  on  toasters  on  epinions  ,  amazon  ,  and  others  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_10	 and  many  people  have  n't  been  very  happy  with  toasters 
11_kitchen_pos_11	 they  have  bought 
11_kitchen_pos_12	 costing  nearly  $  300.00 
11_kitchen_pos_13	 -LRB-  dualit  -RRB-  . 
11_kitchen_pos_14	 Toastmaster  ,  GE  ,  Rival  ,  Dualit  ,  most  Kitchenaid  and  Sunbeam  models  were  poorly  rated  . 
11_kitchen_pos_15	 I  found  one  review  on  this  Sunbeam 
11_kitchen_pos_16	 -LRB-  this  is  their  top  of  the  line  model  ,  the  chrome  and  black  model  costs  more  , 
11_kitchen_pos_17	 but  currently  not  in  production  .  -RRB- 
11_kitchen_pos_18	 and  the  person  really  really  liked  it  . 
11_kitchen_pos_19	 So  I  ordered  this  from  Amazon  directly  ,  this  was  the  VERY  lowest  price 
11_kitchen_pos_20	 I  could  find  . 
11_kitchen_pos_21	 Order  something  else  so 
11_kitchen_pos_22	 as  to  get  their  free  shipping 
11_kitchen_pos_23	 -LRB-  over  $  25.00  -RRB- 
11_kitchen_pos_24	 So  what  happened 
11_kitchen_pos_25	 when  I  got  it  . 
11_kitchen_pos_26	 Got  the  toaster  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_27	 plugged  it  in  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_28	 dropped  two  slices  of  bread  in  , 
11_kitchen_pos_29	 and  excitedly 
11_kitchen_pos_30	 waited  for  my  toast  . 
11_kitchen_pos_31	 A  few  minutes  passed  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_32	 then  .  .  POP 
11_kitchen_pos_33	 its  done  .  .  .  or  so  I  thought  . 
11_kitchen_pos_34	 When  the  toast  came  out  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_35	 it  was  brown  only  on  one  side  the  other  side  poorly  toasted  . 
11_kitchen_pos_36	 This  goes  for  BOTH  slices  . 
11_kitchen_pos_37	 Right  then  and  there  I  was  ready  to  send  this  thing  back  . 
11_kitchen_pos_38	 Well  .  .  .  had  been  busy  that  week 
11_kitchen_pos_39	 and  continued  using  it  day 
11_kitchen_pos_40	 after  day  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_41	 Each  day  was  as  disappointing  as  the  first  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_42	 THEN  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_43	 after  a  little  over  a  week  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_44	 The  bread  started  toasting  .  .  .  uh  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_45	 well  PERFECTLY 
11_kitchen_pos_46	 After  owning  this  for  nearly  4  months  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_47	 it  still  browns  evenly  on  BOTH  sides  of  each  piece  of  bread  ,  crisp  on  the  outside  ,  soft  on  the  inside  . 
11_kitchen_pos_48	 I  do  n't  know 
11_kitchen_pos_49	 why  it  started  working  right  .  .  .  would  n't  think 
11_kitchen_pos_50	" ""that  it  would  need  to  be  """"  broken  in  """""" "
11_kitchen_pos_51	 to  work  right  . 
11_kitchen_pos_52	 I  am  so  glad 
11_kitchen_pos_53	 that  I  did  n't  send  this  back  right  after  the  first  several  toastings  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_54	 Procrastinating  worked  out  in  my  best  interest  ,  for  the  first  time  . 
11_kitchen_pos_55	 I  have  not  tried  Bagels  in  this  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_56	 do  n't  like  bagels  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_57	 but  it  does  well  for  what  I  bought  it  for  . 
11_kitchen_pos_58	 I  think 
11_kitchen_pos_59	 the  style  is  rather  funky  , 
11_kitchen_pos_60	 but  many  people  have  liked  its  looks  . 
11_kitchen_pos_61	 If  this  toaster  works  for  you  as  good 
11_kitchen_pos_62	 as  it  has  for  me  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_63	 I  think 
11_kitchen_pos_64	 you  will  like  it  !  !  ! 
11_kitchen_pos_65	 If  it  does  n't  work  well  right  out  of  the  box  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_66	 you  might  give  it  a  few  days  .  .  . 
11_kitchen_pos_67	 maybe  the  toast  fairy  will  bless  you  too  . 
18_kitchen_pos_1	 I  had  a  Pampered  Chef  sprayer 
18_kitchen_pos_2	 that  I  loved  , 
18_kitchen_pos_3	 but  it  got  clogged  and  stopped  working  after  2  or  3  years  . 
18_kitchen_pos_4	 I  should  have  tried  harder  to  find  a  Pampered  Chef  rep  to  buy  another  one  ,  the  Pampered  Chef  one  works  better  than  this  one  . 
18_kitchen_pos_5	 However  , 
18_kitchen_pos_6	 this  is  not  a  horrible  product  . 
18_kitchen_pos_7	 One  drawback  compared  to  the  Pampered  Chef  one  is  that  you  ca  n't  see  through  this  one  to  see 
18_kitchen_pos_8	 how  high  the  oil  level  is  . 
18_kitchen_pos_9	 You  want  to  fill  it  just  a  bit  higher  than  halfway  , 
18_kitchen_pos_10	and
18_kitchen_pos_11	 when  it  is  less  than  1\/3  full  you  need 
18_kitchen_pos_12	 to  fill  it  back  up  or  it  wo  n't  work  as  well  . 
18_kitchen_pos_13	 This  unit  is  even  more  finicky  than  the  Pampered  Chef  one  about  the  level  , 
18_kitchen_pos_14	 it  almost  wo  n't  spray  if  the  level  is  too  low  . 
18_kitchen_pos_15	 But  since  you  ca  n't  see  through  it  , 
18_kitchen_pos_16	 even  holding  it  up  to  the  light  , 
18_kitchen_pos_17	 you  have  to  look  down  in  and  estimate 
18_kitchen_pos_18	 how  high  it  is  . 
18_kitchen_pos_19	 The  reflective  coating  inside  makes  it  very  hard  to  see 
18_kitchen_pos_20	 how  high  it  really  is  . 
18_kitchen_pos_21	 You  do  n't  want  to  fill  it  all  the  way  up  ,  either  . 
18_kitchen_pos_22	 Then  , 
18_kitchen_pos_23	 you  need 
18_kitchen_pos_24	 to  pump  it  more 
18_kitchen_pos_25	 than  the  Pampered  Chef  one  needed  to  be  pumped  . 
18_kitchen_pos_26	 This  one  sprays  a  very  fine  spray  ,  finer  than  the  Pampered  Chef  one  . 
18_kitchen_pos_27	 And  it  sprays  quite  nicely  if  you  have  the  correct  level  of  oil  in  there  . 
18_kitchen_pos_28	 I  think 
18_kitchen_pos_29	 I  know 
18_kitchen_pos_30	 why  my  old  one  got  clogged  . 
18_kitchen_pos_31	 So  I  'm  trying  something  new  : 
18_kitchen_pos_32	 each  time  I  'm  done  , 
18_kitchen_pos_33	 before  I  put  it  away  , 
18_kitchen_pos_34	 I  twist  the  screw  on  cap  around  the  nozzle 
18_kitchen_pos_35	 and  release  the  pressure  . 
18_kitchen_pos_36	 I  think 
18_kitchen_pos_37	 if  you  leave  it  pressured  up  all  the  time  , 
18_kitchen_pos_38	 like  I  did  with  my  old  one  , 
18_kitchen_pos_39	 it  damages  the  nozzle  over  time  . 
18_kitchen_pos_40	 But  time  will  tell  if  I  'm  right  . 
18_kitchen_pos_41	 Another  tip  --  do  n't  fill  it  with  anything  but  olive  oil  . 
18_kitchen_pos_42	 Other  oils  evaporate 
18_kitchen_pos_43	 and  leave  a  sticky\/greasy  feeling  on  the  outside  of  the  sprayer  . 
18_kitchen_pos_44	 You  know 
18_kitchen_pos_45	 what  I  mean  if  you  use  vegetable  oil  for  stovetop  cooking  a  lot  , 
18_kitchen_pos_46	 you  get  that  greasy  feeling  on  things  that  you  leave  near  the  stove  or  that  hang  over  it  . 
18_kitchen_pos_47	 Olive  oil  does  n't  do  that  , 
18_kitchen_pos_48	 that  's  why  I  now  do  n't  use  anything  else  on  my  stovetop 
18_kitchen_pos_49	 -LRB-  except  sometimes  peanut  oil  for  stir  frying  -RRB-  . 
18_kitchen_pos_50	 This  type  of  sprayer  will  work  much  better  if  you  just  use  Olive  Oil  in  it  ,  trust  me  . 
18_kitchen_pos_51	 But  if  you  have  a  choice  ,  go  find  a  Pampered  Chef  rep  and  by  their  sprayer  . 
18_kitchen_pos_52	 It  's  cheaper  and  better  quality
