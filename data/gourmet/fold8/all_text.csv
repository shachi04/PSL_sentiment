8_gourmet_pos_1	Red Bull used to be my favorite drink ,
8_gourmet_pos_2	as I would not go 24 hours without drinking an entire can .
8_gourmet_pos_3	That era has ended simply
8_gourmet_pos_4	because I was beginning to get sick of paying over $ 2.00 for one can .
8_gourmet_pos_5	I know several distributors
8_gourmet_pos_6	who offer the product for $ 1.50 ,
8_gourmet_pos_7	but I seldomly stock up on the stuff
8_gourmet_pos_8	and end up
8_gourmet_pos_9	paying the $ 2.00 for a can plus 8 % tax ,
8_gourmet_pos_10	which comes out to $ 2.15 a can .
8_gourmet_pos_11	Which is fine
8_gourmet_pos_12	with me until you realize
8_gourmet_pos_13	that you are spending over 700 dollars a year at this rate .
8_gourmet_pos_14	It never stopped me before
8_gourmet_pos_15	and I always felt
8_gourmet_pos_16	that it was worth it ,
8_gourmet_pos_17	considering
8_gourmet_pos_18	the drink helps me focus in college each morning .
8_gourmet_pos_19	However ,
8_gourmet_pos_20	I recently noticed that on days
8_gourmet_pos_21	when I was not in school and I drank a Red Bull ,
8_gourmet_pos_22	rather than being full of energy
8_gourmet_pos_23	and ready to jog ,
8_gourmet_pos_24	I would become tired .
8_gourmet_pos_25	I began to wonder
8_gourmet_pos_26	why I would get tired after drinking a can of Red Bull .
8_gourmet_pos_27	Maybe my inner body was saying ,
8_gourmet_pos_28	"stop drinking this \*\*\*\* every freaking day of your life ! """
8_gourmet_pos_29	Whatever the case is ,
8_gourmet_pos_30	I decided to stop buying it on a daily basis
8_gourmet_pos_31	and just drink it
8_gourmet_pos_32	when I have to wake up very early .
8_gourmet_pos_33	Hopefully this can make
8_gourmet_pos_34	it become effective on my body again ,
8_gourmet_pos_35	because I think
8_gourmet_pos_36	I may have overdone
8_gourmet_pos_37	it ,
8_gourmet_pos_38	considering
8_gourmet_pos_39	I have probably consumed well over 1000 cans in my life .
8_gourmet_pos_40	I personally enjoy drinking a cold can of Red Bull .
8_gourmet_pos_41	Set aside the energy factor .
8_gourmet_pos_42	While many people
8_gourmet_pos_43	-LRB- actually everyone I know -RRB-
8_gourmet_pos_44	says
8_gourmet_pos_45	it is sick
8_gourmet_pos_46	and makes them gag ,
8_gourmet_pos_47	I kinda like that cough droppy taste
8_gourmet_pos_48	that is offered in a can of Red Bull .
8_gourmet_pos_49	I find Red Bull to be a conversation starter for myself - kinda like smoker talk .
8_gourmet_pos_50	I love to sip from my can of Red Bull
8_gourmet_pos_51	and discuss the weather or some other exciting news with my peers .
8_gourmet_pos_52	While I have tried so many other energy drinks ,
8_gourmet_pos_53	I can say
8_gourmet_pos_54	that I do hate all of them .
8_gourmet_pos_55	There has never been an energy drink
8_gourmet_pos_56	that I enjoyed other than Red Bull .
8_gourmet_pos_57	I guess I just like the Austrian people so much
8_gourmet_pos_58	-LRB- and the fact
8_gourmet_pos_59	that a can of Red Bull is vegan ! -RRB-
8_gourmet_pos_60	On the other hand ,
8_gourmet_pos_61	it is full of man-made chemicals
8_gourmet_pos_62	that might do some weird things to me in the future - only time will tell
