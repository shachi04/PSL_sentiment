Now  , 	0.0001
I  have  what  some  would  call  a  large  database  of  contacts  , 	0.28125
but  considering 	0.125
that  the  Palm  OS  version  responded  immediately  with  a  far  more  sophisticated  use  model  this  excuse  does  not  wash  . 	0.625
It  's  simply  a  poorly  architected  database  . 	0.0001
-  The  user  interface  for  entering  a  new  contact  is  rudimentary 	0.3333333333333333
-LRB-  as  are  all  dialog  windows  on  this  device  .  -RRB- 	0.25
-  One  of  the  most  annoying  aspects  of  this  device  is  the  alarm  clock  . 	0.3125
The  user  interface  looks  like  it  was  written  in  10  minutes 	0.25
and  was  clearly  not  verified  for  correctness  . 	0.4375
The  digital  watch  I  had  in  1982  had  the  same  degree  of  sophistication 	0.20833333333333331
but  with  a  more  intuitive  use  model 	0.0001
and  was  more  thoroughly  debugged  . 	0.4375
First  of  all  ,  the  user  only  gets  to  select  a  time  and  if  the  alarm  is  on  or  off  . 	0.25
From  the  interface 	0.0001
you  would  assume  you  could  only  set  a  single  alarm  .  .  . 	0.375
if  only  it  were  that  obvious  . 	0.375
The  best  way  to  explain  this  buggy  piece  of  software  is  with  an  example  : 	0.4166666666666667
I  set  the  alarm  for  6am  ; 	0.375
the  next  day  the  alarm  goes  off  at  6am  . 	0.375
That  day  I  set  the  alarm  for  7am  - 	0.375
the  following  day  the  alarm  goes  off  at  6am  and  7am  . 	0.375
The  next  day  I  set  the  alarm  for  7:30  am  and  you  guessed  it  , 	0.25
the  alarm  now  goes  off  three  times  . 	0.4375
The  best  that  I  `  ve  been  able  to  deduce 	0.375
-LRB-  of  course  ,  this  type  of  behavior 	0.25
is  not  documented  in  the  user  manual 	0.1875
that  comes  with  the  device  -RRB- 	0.0001
"is  that  the  user  has  to  actively  select  ""  off  ""  for  the  current  setting "	0.3333333333333333
"before  setting  ""  on  ""  for  the  new  time  . "	0.375
But  there  is  no  indication  of  what  alarms  are  set  ,  so  after  a  while  or  a  particularly  busy  week  you  can  loose  track  of  what  's  set  and  what  is  n't  .  .  .  the  only  way  to  clear  all  of  the  alarms 	0.296875
that  have  been  set  is  a  hard  re-boot  . 	0.25
-  The  calculator  is  a  joke  . 	0.3125
If  this  took  an  engineer  10  minutes  to  write  they  should  be  fired  . 	0.25
A  calculator  watch  in  the  '  80  's  had  more  sophisticated  features  . 	0.625
The  user  interface  is  so  bad 	0.25
it  's  hard  to  describe  it  in  words  . 	0.0001
-  Microsoft  truly  does  not  understand 	0.5
how  a  user  would  like  to  use  the  device 	0.125

Some  features  are  simply  hard  to  find  , 	0.1875
but  should  it  really  take  so  many  menu  selections 	0.625
to  find  common  tools  or  applications  ? 	0.0001

The  only  way  around  this  is  to  cancel  reminders  for  all  day  events  .  .  . 	0.25
otherwise 	0.5
you  get  an  alarm  at  midnight  . 	0.25

connected  at  all  . 	0.0001
-  ActiveSync  : 	0.0001
This  is  the  most  annoying  piece  of  software  in  that  it  just  does  not  work  . 	0.25
Worse  still  , 	0.0001
when  it  does  not  work  it  gives  a  cryptic  error  message 	0.0001

My  wife  got  this  Cuisinart  Classic  Toaster  oven  as  a  wedding  gift  . 	0.4375
We  liked  the  appearance 	0.125
and  had  it  on  our  registry  . 	0.25
We  used  this  toaster  oven  a  lot 	0.625
because  it  cooked  very  well  . 	0.3125
Toast  was  perfect  , 	0.4375
and  the  oven 	0.0001
cooked  nice  and  hot  . 	0.875
We  broiled  meats 	0.0001
and  made  all  kind  of  things  in  it  . 	0.0001
We  found  it  hard  to  clean  . 	0.125
We  would  take  the  baking  pan\/and  crumb  tray 	0.0001

Then  after  about  1  year  one  of  the  plastic  feet  broke  off 	0.0001
when  simply  adjusting  the  position  of  the  oven  on  the  counter  . 	0.125
I  glued 	0.0001
it  back  on  with  super  glue  . 	0.375
It  broke  again 	0.25
and  seemed  to  become  more  brittle  over  time  because  of  the  heat  so  I  had  to  fix  this  plastic  foot  a  few  times  . 	0.375
Then  another  problem  arose  . 	0.0001
The  toaster  and  the  one  light  would  shut  off  a  few  second  after  pressing  start  . 	0.625
So  to  make  toast 	0.0001
we  just  used  the  un-timed  bake  function  , 	0.0001
but  then  we  would  have  to  watch  so  we  did  not  burn  the  toast  . 	0.1875
Still  we  lived  with  it  . 	0.0001
Then  after  about  another  four  months  all  of  the  controls  stopped  working  . 	0.0001
So  it  does  not  bake  . 	0.0001
I  think 	0.0001
I  knew 	0.0001
this  was  going  to  happen 	0.25
because  I  would  hear  a  strange  buzz 	0.0001

when  ever  I  turned  the  dial 	0.0001

So  therefore  I  think 	0.0001
the  electrical  wiring  was  not  heavy  duty  enough  or  the  electrical  system  was  not  soldered  well  or  protected  well  enough  to  last  . 	0.25
I  would  have  expected  better  quality  . 	0.4375
Considering  how  long  we  have  been  making  toaster  ovens  , 	0.3125
I  think 	0.0001
that  it  would  have  not  been  too  hard  for  them  to  have  made  a  more  heavy  duty  electrical  system  for  the  controls  . 	0.2
So  like  other  reviews  say  , 	0.125
it  does  cook  well  and  evenly  , 	0.375
but  it  is  hard  to  clean  and  does  not  last  . 	0.1875
If  I  were  to  have  rated  the  product  before  the  problems  started  I  would  have  given  it  4  stars  . 	0.21875
I  wish  that  Amazon  and  these  sites  had  a  section  for  long  term  reviews 	0.15

______________ 	0.0001
Since  writing  my  review  above 	0.125
I  tried  to  fix  my  oven  to  no  avail  , 	0.0001
but  I  have  gained  more  insight  into  its  design 	0.25
and  perhaps 	0.0001
why  it  broke  . 	0.25
My  recommendations  are  as  follows  . 	0.25
Since  I  know 	0.0001
"that  the  rotary  controls  and  the  circuit  board  of  this  ""  Classic  ""  model  product  can  over  time  get  dirty  and  stop  working  , "	0.5
I  recommend  that  people  who  own  this  oven  keep  it  far  away  from  any  other  cooking  products 	0.0001
that  create  grease  or  steam  such  as  range  tops  ,  rice  cookers  ,  deep  fryers  ,  pressure  cookers  ,  or  kitchen  sinks  . 	0.0001
Especially  keep  the  vents  near  the  controls  on  the  right  side  of  this  unit  away  from  these  sources  of  moisture  and  grease  . 	0.0001
I  recommend  consumers  to  consider  the  newer  models  with  digital  controls  , 	0.20833333333333331
which  might  have  a  different  mechanism  inside  or  the  models  with  the  controls  beneath 	0.4375
and  therefore  the  electrical  components 	0.0001
and  cooling  vents  underneath  the  oven  and  not  in  an  exposed  location  . 	0.125
This  might  make  the  unit  last  longer  . 	0.0001
The  newer  Cuisinart  models  with  the  knobs  or  digital  controls  beneath  the  oven  might  be  a  design  improvement  to  correct  the  sort  of  problem 	0.275
I  had  . 	0.25
Or  perhaps  other  manufactures  have  solved  electrical  component  problem  other  ways  . 	0.25
Maybe  1.5  years  is  average  life  ,  or  maybe  the  fact 	0.25
that  my  oven  was  placed  near  the  cooking  range  in  my  kitchen 	0.1875
made  my  unit  more  susceptible  to  malfunction  . 	0.5
Reviews  of  lots  of  other  brand  models  show  short  life  spans  for  these  products  . 	0.25
From  the  reviews  and  my  observations  above  , 	0.125
I  think 	0.0001
the  Krups  models  and  the  improved  Cuisinart  models  might  last  a  longer  time  than  this  classic  model 	0.375
that  died  on  me  . 	0.0001
