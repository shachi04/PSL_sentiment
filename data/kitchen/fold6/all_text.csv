6_kitchen_pos_1	Using a Chemex requires water to be heated in a tea kettle prior to brewing ,
6_kitchen_pos_2	and it requires a finer ground than what auto-drip machines ask for .
6_kitchen_pos_3	After the water is brought to a boil ,
6_kitchen_pos_4	it 's important to wait for it to cool just slightly
6_kitchen_pos_5	-LRB- about 30 seconds -RRB-
6_kitchen_pos_6	and
6_kitchen_pos_7	then
6_kitchen_pos_8	you need
6_kitchen_pos_9	to wet the grounds in the filter , wait for them to drain ,
6_kitchen_pos_10	and then fill the pot with water .
6_kitchen_pos_11	Want more than a single cup of coffee ?
6_kitchen_pos_12	You wait for your first pour to brew ,
6_kitchen_pos_13	and then fill the filter again .
6_kitchen_pos_14	Some advantages over other forms of coffee brewing :
6_kitchen_pos_15	1 . Taste :
6_kitchen_pos_16	I do n't know
6_kitchen_pos_17	how it does it ,
6_kitchen_pos_18	but the filter does keep your coffee from being bitter .
6_kitchen_pos_19	2 . Cleanability :
6_kitchen_pos_20	Users can keep all necessary components clean
6_kitchen_pos_21	-LRB- anyone
6_kitchen_pos_22	who 's brewed water and vinegar through their coffee maker to kill off a bitter taste
6_kitchen_pos_23	that was n't there
6_kitchen_pos_24	when you bought
6_kitchen_pos_25	it understands this plight -RRB- .
6_kitchen_pos_26	Oftentimes , the most aggressive criticism of the Chemex is its ponderousness
6_kitchen_pos_27	to clean
6_kitchen_pos_28	because it 's not possible to get your hand into the reservoir .
6_kitchen_pos_29	Some people prefer
6_kitchen_pos_30	to add hot water and soap and give it a good rinse ,
6_kitchen_pos_31	which is fine if you clean the moment
6_kitchen_pos_32	you empty the pot ,
6_kitchen_pos_33	but if you ` re like me
6_kitchen_pos_34	and you let
6_kitchen_pos_35	the remaining sip or two sit
6_kitchen_pos_36	until a nice coffee stain is on the glass ,
6_kitchen_pos_37	then you need some good ' ol fashion friction
6_kitchen_pos_38	to get
6_kitchen_pos_39	it clean .
6_kitchen_pos_40	The best thing I ` ve found :
6_kitchen_pos_41	a baby bottle cleaner .
6_kitchen_pos_42	It 's narrow enough
6_kitchen_pos_43	to get into the reservoir
6_kitchen_pos_44	and the angle can be adjusted to scrap the walls , too .
6_kitchen_pos_45	Brilliant !
6_kitchen_pos_46	3 . Electricity Free :
6_kitchen_pos_47	As long as you can boil water ,
6_kitchen_pos_48	you can have coffee .
6_kitchen_pos_49	4 . Mud\/Sludge :
6_kitchen_pos_50	French press and stove-top
6_kitchen_pos_51	espresso-style brewing always leaves a thick slime at the bottom of an otherwise rich cup of coffee .
6_kitchen_pos_52	Do n't get
6_kitchen_pos_53	me wrong :
6_kitchen_pos_54	I think
6_kitchen_pos_55	that 's good
6_kitchen_pos_56	-LRB- I use a French Press
6_kitchen_pos_57	when I 'm in the mood -RRB- ,
6_kitchen_pos_58	but the cone on a Chemex does n't allow that at all .
6_kitchen_pos_59	5 . Style\/Size :
6_kitchen_pos_60	the Chemex coffee pot is a relic
6_kitchen_pos_61	-LRB- designed in the 40s -RRB-
6_kitchen_pos_62	and the wood cuff with rawhide tie screams simplicity and elegance
6_kitchen_pos_63	and it 's a wonderful , minimalist sight on any kitchen counter
6_kitchen_pos_64	-LRB- and unlike electric coffee makers , easy to move if you need the space -RRB- .
6_kitchen_pos_65	Some drawbacks any purchaser should consider :
6_kitchen_pos_66	1 . Time :
6_kitchen_pos_67	it does take 5
6_kitchen_pos_68	-
6_kitchen_pos_69	10 minutes of labor
6_kitchen_pos_70	to get the morning cup of coffee .
6_kitchen_pos_71	2 . Cones :
6_kitchen_pos_72	you ca n't run over to Wal-Mart
6_kitchen_pos_73	when you use the last filter ;
6_kitchen_pos_74	you need
6_kitchen_pos_75	to find a specialty store or go online ,
6_kitchen_pos_76	which means
6_kitchen_pos_77	you need
6_kitchen_pos_78	to plan ahead .
6_kitchen_pos_79	3 . Cold Coffee :
6_kitchen_pos_80	no electric hot plate
6_kitchen_pos_81	-LRB- thank god -RRB-
6_kitchen_pos_82	means coffee not poured and consumed immediately gets cold quickly .
6_kitchen_pos_83	You can buy a wire guard and a glass lid so your Chemex can be warmed on the stovetop .
6_kitchen_pos_84	I think
6_kitchen_pos_85	that 's more labor
6_kitchen_pos_86	added to an already laborious endeavor .
6_kitchen_pos_87	Just have a warmed thermos ready
6_kitchen_pos_88	and use that to store any unused coffee .
6_kitchen_pos_89	4 . Learning Curve :
6_kitchen_pos_90	It does take some time to get the grind right , the amount right
6_kitchen_pos_91	and the water level right to find a cup
6_kitchen_pos_92	which caters to your tongue .
6_kitchen_pos_93	5 .
6_kitchen_pos_94	Cleanability :
6_kitchen_pos_95	I know
6_kitchen_pos_96	this is in the advantages column , as well ,
6_kitchen_pos_97	but it 's worth
6_kitchen_pos_98	mentioning
6_kitchen_pos_99	that a lot of people hate
6_kitchen_pos_100	cleaning these things .
6_kitchen_pos_101	To submerge it does mean pulling off the wood cuff
6_kitchen_pos_102	-LRB-
6_kitchen_pos_103	which is a small pain -RRB-
6_kitchen_pos_104	else
6_kitchen_pos_105	it will get nasty over time
