17_kitchen_neg_1	I ` ve own my X3 for about 2 years now
17_kitchen_neg_2	and overall ,
17_kitchen_neg_3	it has been used to make one double espresso daily .
17_kitchen_neg_4	So
17_kitchen_neg_5	when it stopped working a month ago ,
17_kitchen_neg_6	I was heartbroken .
17_kitchen_neg_7	Called FF ,
17_kitchen_neg_8	after some back and forth I sent the machine in for repair .
17_kitchen_neg_9	The cost of repairing it is about $ 200 , incl .
17_kitchen_neg_10	the shipping .
17_kitchen_neg_11	Add that to the $ 499 I paid for it
17_kitchen_neg_12	and this turns out to be one very expensive machine .
17_kitchen_neg_13	After several days of back and forth with customer service ,
17_kitchen_neg_14	I still do n't know what exactly is not working in my machine .
17_kitchen_neg_15	Apparently ,
17_kitchen_neg_16	there are 3 items
17_kitchen_neg_17	that have failed ,
17_kitchen_neg_18	one being the thermostat , a washer and something else ,
17_kitchen_neg_19	that CS was unable to explain .
17_kitchen_neg_20	I really liked the machine
17_kitchen_neg_21	when it was working ,
17_kitchen_neg_22	so I gave it some serious thought of shelling for repair ,
17_kitchen_neg_23	but at the end decided against it -
17_kitchen_neg_24	I rather purchase a new Rancilio Silvia .
17_kitchen_neg_25	When I called the CS with me decision
17_kitchen_neg_26	and asked them to send the machine back , I was told
17_kitchen_neg_27	that on top of the $ 12 shipping
17_kitchen_neg_28	there will be a $ 13 handling charge for packaging the machine .
17_kitchen_neg_29	I refused to pay that
17_kitchen_neg_30	and the rep turned outright nasty .
17_kitchen_neg_31	Long story short ,
17_kitchen_neg_32	I finally got them to send the machine back with just a shipping charge , but that was one very unpleasant experience .
17_kitchen_neg_33	It is a whole
17_kitchen_neg_34	another issue
17_kitchen_neg_35	what additional damage they might have done to my machine
17_kitchen_neg_36	after the nasty fight
17_kitchen_neg_37	I had with them .
17_kitchen_neg_38	I really liked the X3
17_kitchen_neg_39	when it was working ,
17_kitchen_neg_40	and I would love to have it back ,
17_kitchen_neg_41	but it is just not cost effective at all .
17_kitchen_neg_42	What is really confusing to me is that with the low usage my machine had and the maintenance I provided ,
17_kitchen_neg_43	it has 3 parts
17_kitchen_neg_44	needing replacement
17_kitchen_neg_45	- if this was a good quality machine ,
17_kitchen_neg_46	it should have worked a lot longer without any problems .
