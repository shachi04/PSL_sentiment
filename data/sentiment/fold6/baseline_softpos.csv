I  purchased  . 	0.0001
Here  are  the  main  issues  I  have  found  with  this  phone  : 	0.21875
1  -RRB-  The  buttons  are  too  small  , 	0.1875
particularly  the  main  control  button  . 	0.25
You  have  to  used  the  side  of  your  fingers 	0.25
to  ensure 	0.0001
that  you  do  not  hit  too  buttons  at  the  same  time  . 	0.125
And  ,  believe 	0.125
me  , 	0.0001
I  do  not  have  very  large  hands  . 	0.25
2  -RRB-  If  you  have  quite  a  few  contacts  in  your  phone  , 	0.3125
you  will  be  irritated  by  the  delay 	0.25
when  you  scroll  down  quickly  to  select  a  contact  . 	0.375
You  will  notice  that  if  you  are  not  careful  , 	0.375
you  will  dial  the  wrong  contact  due 	0.25
to  the  delay 	0.0001
when  scrolling  and  selecting  quickly  ,  so  if  this  is  you  ,  be  aware  . 	0.3333333333333333
3  -RRB-  You 	0.0001
must  open  the  cover 	0.0001
and  look  inside  to  see  if  you  have  missed  a  call  or  have  a  message  . 	0.25
VERY  INCONVENIENT  !  ! 	0.0001
There  is  no  indication  to  show  this  on  the  top  screen  ,  only  the  inside  screen  . 	0.25
4  -RRB-  On  occasion  ,  the  display  on  the  outside  of  the  phone  stops 	0.0001
working  entirely  . 	0.5
What  you  just  need  to  do  is  power  the  phone  down 	0.25
and  they  back  up  again  . 	0.375
Not  optimal  , 	0.0001
and  I  probably  just  got  a  bad  phone  , 	0.125
but  I  am  just  waiting  for  the  situation  to  get  more  frequent  , 	0.1875
so  I  can  then  deal  with  the  likely  nightmare  of  having  to  get  a  replacement  phone  from  Motorola  . 	0.25
NOTE  : 	0.0001
I  have  no  personal  vendetta  against  Motorola  , 	0.25
but  wanted  to  provide  some  real  feedback  rather  than  all  just  rosey  stuff 	0.375
I  bought  into  before  purchasing 	0.0001
Well  I  read  through  just  about  every  review  prior  to  purchasing  this  phone 	0.125
and  was  almost  thinking  twice  about  it 	0.25
after  reading  some  of  the  reviews  here  , 	0.125
but  I  decided  to  take  the  plunge 	0.0001
and  go  for  it  . 	0.0001
Well  I  'm  glad 	0.125
I  did  . 	0.0001
All  I  can  say  is  this  phone 	0.25
has  been  a  pleasure 	0.25
to  use  from  the  get-go  . 	0.125
It  has  its  flaws 	0.25
but  what  phone  does  n't  ? 	0.0001
The  question  is  whether  you  `  re  going  go  flip  out  over  an  alarm  clock  or  volume  strip  or  is  it  a  trivial  issue  for  you  . 	0.225
Most  of  the  gripes  others  have  had  just  seem  little  to  me  . 	0.25
Let  's  talk  about  the  pros  and  cons  : 	0.0001
Pros  : 	0.0001

so  I  ca  n't  complain  . 	0.0001
As  a  phone 	0.0001
it  does 	0.0001
what  it  's  supposed  to  do  . 	0.0001
Make  good  quality  calls  . 	0.4375
It  also  pairs  with  my  bluetooth  headset 	0.0001

I  have  the  $  5.99  plan 	0.25

but  it  gets  the  job 	0.125
done  . 	0.0001
It  does  n't  matter 	0.0001
where  I  'm  at  I  can  check  my  email  , 	0.5

when  I  'm  bored  . 	0.125
It  really  came  in  handy 	0.625
when  I  was  out  on  vacation 	0.25
and  lost  . 	0.0001
WiFi  works  well  too  . 	0.25
Did  n't  want  to  fork  out  the  money  for  hotspots  though  . 	0.25
3  .  The  camera  at  1.3  megapixels  is  decent  quality  . 	0.4166666666666667
No  it  's  not  going  to  replace  my  regular  camera 	0.0001
but  I  found  it  really  handy 	0.625
when  I  forgot  to  take  my  camera  to  my  friend  's  wedding  , 	0.1875
but  was  still  able  to  take  quality  pictures  . 	0.25
I  have  n't  tried  videos  yet  though  . 	0.25
4  . 	0.0001
Mp3\/Video  player  : 	0.0001
Now  the  speakers  on  this  phone  are  n't  the  greatest  so  I  would  n't  use  them  for  listening  to  music 	0.25
but  when  plugged  into  a  headset 	0.0001
it  sounds  pretty  good  . 	0.4375
I  bought 	0.0001
a  2GB  microSD  card  bought  here  at  Amazon 	0.125
and  now  I  can  hold  a  ton  music  and  movies  . 	0.0001
Videos  looks  pretty  nice 	0.5
I  'd  have  to  admit  . 	0.1875
This  thing  is  my  travelinig  entertainment  center  . 	0.25
I  even  found  a  way  to  play  original  nintendo  games  on  this  thing 	0.1875
and  have  been  trying  Mike  Tyson  's  Punchout  like  back  in  the  old  days  . 	0.2916666666666667
5  .  Calendar\/schedule  : 	0.0001
I  had  a  PDA 	0.25
but  for  some  reason 	0.0001
I  'm  more  compelled  to  actually  use  my  calendar 	0.375
and  keep  my  schedule  on  this  thing 	0.0001
than  I  did  with  my  Pocket  PC  . 	0.0001
Probably  because  of  convenience  reasons  . 	0.375
6  .  Smartphone  applications  : 	0.0001
I  'm  in  the  medical  field 	0.0001
and  I  keep  all  my  medical  applications  on  this  phone  . 	0.0001
I  can  quickly  look  up  drug  references  or  research  diseases  . 	0.375
I  really  thought  I  'd  need  a  touchscreen 	0.4375
in  order  to  better  navigate  these  programs 	0.875
and  while  it  might  be  slightly  easier  with  a  stylus  , 	0.4375
I  do  n't  find  that  it  's  all  that 	0.0001
necessary 	0.625
and  still  navigate  pretty  well  . 	0.375
I  just  wish  the  processor  were  slightly  faster  for  some  of  these  apps  , 	0.25
but  it  's  more  than  adequate  . 	0.0001
And  I  'm  not  sure 	0.25
why  people  do  n't  think 	0.0001
there  are  a  lot  of  programs  for  the  smartphone  . 	0.25
Programs  written  for  WM5  are  compatable  with  PPC  as  well  as  smartphones  equally  . 	0.3125
-LRB-  .  .  .  -RRB-  . 	0.0001
7  .  Appearance  : 	0.0001
Everyone  who  sees  this  phone  absolutely  loves  its  looks 	0.5
and  so  do  I  . 	0.0001
It  looks  great 	0.0001
and  feels  great  . 	0.125
I  saw  this  side  by  side  with  the  Motorola  Q 	0.0001
and  the  Q  just  looked  so  much  bulkier  and  .  .  .  well  .  .  .  not 	0.25
as  nice  . 	0.875
The  rubber  backing  feels  awesome  . 	0.125
8  . 	0.0001
Battery  : 	0.0001
For  all 	0.0001
that  I  use  this  phone 	0.0001
for  it  makes  it  through  the  day  with  plenty  battery  to  spare 	0.0001
which  is  all 	0.25
I  can  really  ask  for  . 	0.625
I  would  n't  go  2  days  without  charging  the  battery  though  . 	0.0001
You  should  charge  it  every  night  . 	0.0001
Cons  : 	0.0001
1  . 	0.0001
Windows  Mobile  5  : 	0.0001
Mighty  Microsoft  needs  to  write  a  cleaner  program  . 	0.375
However  Windows  Mobile  6  is  on  the  way 	0.1875
and  will  be  free  to  download  for  T-Mobile  customer  soon 	0.3125
so  hopefully  that  `  ll  take  care  of  some  of  the  problems  . 	0.5
I  swear  just  to  turn  on  the  bluetooth 	0.0001
and  pair  up  my  bluetooth  device 	0.0001
takes  me  a  whole  minute  just  because  of  how  hard  it  is  to  navigate  WM5  . 	0.1875
2  . 	0.0001
Volume  strip  : 	0.0001
Yeah  like  everyone  says 	0.0001
it  sucks  . 	0.0001
I  disabled  mine  . 	0.0001
Adjusting  the  volume  with  this  thing  is  tedious  at  best  . 	0.375
Luckily  my  music\/video  programs  as  well  as  my  stereo  headset  allow 	0.4375
me  easier  ways  to  adjust  the  volume 	0.375
so  it  's  not  such  an  issue  for  me  . 	0.125
3  .  Alarm  clock  : 	0.375
Now  I  do  n't  use  this  all  that  much 	0.0001
but  I  see  what  everyone  says 	0.0001
about  it 	0.0001
and  yeah  it  's  a  pretty  idiotic  written  program  . 	0.125
However  rather  than  writing  half  a  page  on  how  bad  it  is  I  downloaded  a  free  one  from  the  internet 	0.3125
that  works  great 	0.0001
so  my  life  now  goes  on  . 	0.0001
Summary  : 	0.0001
So  I  use  this  device  to  make  quality  phone  calls  ,  surf  the  web  ,  check  email  ,  play  games  ,  listen  to  music  ,  watch  movies  ,  monitor  my  schedule  ,  check  my  medical  references  , 	0.2916666666666667
and  take  decent  quality  pictures  . 	0.375
All  this  thing  needs 	0.25
now  is  a  laser  beam 	0.25
that  will  cut  through  metal 	0.125
and  it  'd  be  the  greatest  gadget 	0.25
known  to  man 	0.0001
I  normally  do  n't  write  reviews  .  .  . 	0.125
but  after  owning  several  toasters  in  the  past  , 	0.625
and  being  very  disappointed  , 	0.25
I  just  had  to  write  about  this  one  . 	0.25
I  owned  an  old  Toastmaster  4  slice  toaster  for  about  20  years  . 	0.5
It  never  did  brown  evenly  ,  but  was  a  workhorse 	0.25
until  finally  the  bread  crumb  tray  broke  . 	0.0001
Got  my  money  's  worth  . 	0.0001
I  have  done  a  lot  of  research  on  toasters  on  epinions  ,  amazon  ,  and  others  .  .  . 	0.3333333333333333
and  many  people  have  n't  been  very  happy  with  toasters 	0.45
they  have  bought 	0.25
costing  nearly  $  300.00 	0.0001
-LRB-  dualit  -RRB-  . 	0.0001
Toastmaster  ,  GE  ,  Rival  ,  Dualit  ,  most  Kitchenaid  and  Sunbeam  models  were  poorly  rated  . 	0.16666666666666666
I  found  one  review  on  this  Sunbeam 	0.125
-LRB-  this  is  their  top  of  the  line  model  ,  the  chrome  and  black  model  costs  more  , 	0.25
but  currently  not  in  production  .  -RRB- 	0.0001
and  the  person  really  really  liked  it  . 	0.4583333333333333
So  I  ordered  this  from  Amazon  directly  ,  this  was  the  VERY  lowest  price 	0.1875
I  could  find  . 	0.0001
Order  something  else  so 	0.0001
as  to  get  their  free  shipping 	0.25
-LRB-  over  $  25.00  -RRB- 	0.0001
So  what  happened 	0.0001
when  I  got  it  . 	0.125
Got  the  toaster  .  .  . 	0.625
plugged  it  in  .  .  . 	0.0001
dropped  two  slices  of  bread  in  , 	0.0001
and  excitedly 	0.125
waited  for  my  toast  . 	0.0001
A  few  minutes  passed  .  .  . 	0.0001
then  .  .  POP  ! 	0.0001
its  done  .  .  .  or  so  I  thought  . 	0.0001
When  the  toast  came  out  .  .  . 	0.0001
it  was  brown  only  on  one  side  the  other  side  poorly  toasted  . 	0.25
This  goes  for  BOTH  slices  . 	0.0001
Right  then  and  there  I  was  ready  to  send  this  thing  back  . 	0.25
Well  .  .  .  had  been  busy  that  week 	0.2916666666666667
and  continued  using  it  day 	0.0001
after  day  .  .  . 	0.0001
Each  day  was  as  disappointing  as  the  first  .  .  . 	0.25
THEN  .  .  . 	0.0001
after  a  little  over  a  week  .  .  . 	0.0001
The  bread  started  toasting  .  .  .  uh  .  . 	0.0001
well  PERFECTLY  !  !  ! 	0.4375
After  owning  this  for  nearly  4  months  .  .  . 	0.0001
it  still  browns  evenly  on  BOTH  sides  of  each  piece  of  bread  ,  crisp  on  the  outside  ,  soft  on  the  inside  . 	0.0001
I  do  n't  know 	0.0001
why  it  started  working  right  .  .  .  would  n't  think 	0.25
"that  it  would  need  to  be  ""  broken  in  "" "	0.25
to  work  right  . 	0.25
I  am  so  glad 	0.1875
that  I  did  n't  send  this  back  right  after  the  first  several  toastings  .  .  . 	0.25
Procrastinating  worked  out  in  my  best  interest  ,  for  the  first  time  . 	0.75
I  have  not  tried  Bagels  in  this  .  .  . 	0.25
do  n't  like  bagels  .  .  . 	0.125
but  it  does  well  for  what  I  bought  it  for  . 	0.375
I  think 	0.0001
the  style  is  rather  funky  , 	0.375
but  many  people  have  liked  its  looks  . 	0.1875
If  this  toaster  works  for  you  as  good 	0.6875
as  it  has  for  me  .  .  . 	0.25
I  think 	0.0001
you  will  like  it  !  !  ! 	0.125
If  it  does  n't  work  well  right  out  of  the  box  .  .  . 	0.3125
you  might  give  it  a  few  days  .  .  . 	0.0001
maybe  the  toast  fairy  will  bless  you  too  . 	0.125
When  I  ordered  this  product  , 	0.0001
it  had  a  4  star  average  rating  - 	0.25
how  that  happened  is  beyond  me  . 	0.25
Were  a  zero  star  rating  available  ,  this  product  would  n't  even  deserve  the  string  of  uncolored  stars  ! 	0.375
I  purchased 	0.0001
it  , 	0.0001
thinking 	0.0001
"it  would  certainly  do  better  than  the  plastic  ""  freebie  ""  grinder "	0.5625
that  came  with  some  peppercorns  about  a  year  ago  . 	0.0001
After  many  refills  , 	0.0001
that  all-plastic  grinder  has  finially  started  to  wear  out 	0.25
and  peppercorns  get 	0.125
"stuck  in  the  ""  gears  ""  ,  the  grinder  has  started  to  squeak  and  spits  out  chunks  of  pepper  . "	0.25
So  I  order  this  one  --  it  's  attractive  ,  low\/mid  priced 	0.875
and  offers  a  warranty  against  wearing  out  -- 	0.0001
and  guess  what  ? 	0.125
I  'm  still  using  the  plastic  worn-out  grinder  ! 	0.0001
This  MIU  grinder  was  a  total  waste  of  money  and  I  just  ca  n't  bear  to  listen  to  it  squeal 	0.16666666666666666
when  I  attempt 	0.0001
to  use  it  . 	0.0001
Its  adjustement  is  loose  enough  , 	0.1875
that  's  not  the  problem  . 	0.0001
What  good  's  a  lifetime  warranty  against  wearing  out  if  I  'm  not  going  to  use  the  grinder  at  all  ? 	0.75
Now  I  'm  stuck  with  it  , 	0.0001
unless  I  want  to  pay  to  ship  it  back 	0.25
and  lose  free  shipping  discount  on  the  original  order  ,  so  basically  ,  I  may  could  get  a  few  bucks  back  . 	0.3125
Which  is  probably  what  I  `  ll  do 	0.25
because  this  grinder  is  n't  worth  2  cents  ! 	0.25
I  would  n't  even  give  the  thing  away  . 	0.125
Maybe  pepper  grinders  are  one  of  those  things  you  just  need  to  feel  and  buy  in  person  . 	0.20833333333333331
I  `  ll  certainly  not  purchase  another  one  online  . 	0.25
If  you  like  the  sound  of  fingernails 	0.125
scratching  a  chalkboard  ,  buy  this  grinder  . 	0.0001
Buy  a  second  one  for  your  salt 	0.5
while  you  `  re  at  it  . 	0.0001
You  `  ll  love  'em  ! 	0.0001
-LRB-  Update  1  month  later  -  I  tried 	0.0001
to  give  this  thing  a  chance 	0.5
and  the  god-awful  squealing  is  becoming  less  consistent  . 	0.25
Which  might  be  even  worse  , 	0.1875
as  it  now  takes  me  by  surprise  as  it  lets  out  a  high-pitched  jag  every  so  often  . 	0.375
It  's  gotten  quite  worse  ,  however  , 	0.125
with  spitting  out  various  sized  chunks  of  peppercorn  .  .  . 	0.125
from  fine 	0.0001
grind  to  quarter-corn  sized  pieces 	0.125
in  a  few  turns  . 	0.0001
Not  recommended  at  all  . 	0.0001
I  might  try  switching  it  over  to  salt  ,  maybe  it  can  handle  that  better  . 	0.875

"Tazo  describes  the  aroma  as  ""  vegetative  ,  popcorn  ""  . "	0.0001
I  would  rate  this  tea  ,  and  Tazo  in  general  ,  as  very  good  --  better  than  premium  teas  like  Stash  or  Celestial  Seasonings  -- 	0.5
but  not  as  good  as  Numi  or  Aspen  . 	0.75
Still  ,  this  tea  is  excellent  ,  so  I  'm  breaking  my  tradition  with  Tazo  teas 	0.25
and  giving  it  five  stars  . 	0.0001
If  you  enjoy  super  premium  teas  , 	0.375

I  ca  n't  honestly  say  that 	0.375

I  must  write  quickly  , 	0.0001
for  soon  ,  soon  ,  the  Milk  will  awake  within  me  again  . 	0.0001
And  it  will  know  , 	0.0001
but  you  will  have  been  warned  . 	0.25
The  Milk  will  punish  me  , 	0.0001
but  it  knows 	0.0001
it  must  have  a  host  , 	0.25
so  I  will  survive  - 	0.0001

I  too  was  once  tempted  by  the  smooth  ,  sweet  creaminess  of  Tuscan  Milk  ,  1  Gallon  ,  128  Fl  Oz  . 	0.1875
I  too  read  the  odes 	0.125
written  to  its  greatness  , 	0.25
not  knowing 	0.0001
that  the  Milk  was  forcing  it  's  hosts 	0.3125

But  then  came  that  terrible  moment 	0.0001
when  in  my  home  town  supermarket  , 	0.0001
I  reached  for  a  gallon  of  store  brand  milk  , 	0.0001
and  felt  the  pain  . 	0.0001
Oh  ,  the  pain  the  Milk  can  give  ! 	0.0001

Oh  ,  the  shame 	0.0001

I  `  ve  previously  had  subscription  cell  phone  services  with  a  variety  of  providers  , 	0.25
but  found 	0.0001
I  rarely  used  the  number  of  minutes 	0.0001
I  was  paying  for  . 	0.25
A  prepaid  phone  service  seemed  like  the  way  to  go  , 	0.0001
and  STI  Mobile  sounded  like  a  good  alternative 	0.75
because  the  price  was  competitive 	0.25
and  minutes  do  n't  expire  . 	0.125
I  signed  up 	0.0001
and  shortly  after  received  my  Samsung  phone  . 	0.0001
It  arrived  ,  however  , 	0.125
defective  -  the  port  for  recharging  the  phone  was  damaged  . 	0.25
Per  the  STI  Mobile  web  site  , 	0.25
I  contacted 	0.0001
them  within  14  days  to  arrange  for  a  replacement  phone  . 	0.125
This  resulted  in  a  number  of  email  exchanges  with  customer  service  . 	0.0001
In  the  first  one  ,  the  rep  told  me 	0.0001
that  I  was  mistaken  , 	0.25
and  must  have  been  sent  the  wrong  charger  . 	0.1875
No  offer  was  made  to  replace  the  charger  ,  strangely  , 	0.20833333333333331
which  was  included  as  part  of  the  package  deal  . 	0.25
After  additional  emails 	0.0001
where  I  reassured  her 	0.0001
that  I  did  in  fact  have  the  right  charger 	0.1875
-LRB-  I  took  the  phone  in  to  a  local  merchant  , 	0.0001
who  showed  me  the  charger 	0.125
I  was  shipped 	0.25
worked  with  an  identical  model  phone  - 	0.0001
it  was  the  port  on  the  shipped  phone 	0.25
that  was  defective  -RRB-  . 	0.25
At  this  point  ,  the  rep  apologized  and  told  me 	0.0001
I  would  have  to  contact  Samsung  for  a  replacement  phone  ! 	0.25
This  entire  process  took  several  weeks  . 	0.0001
In  short  , 	0.0001
I  guess  you  get 	0.125
what  you  pay  for  . 	0.0001
If  I  had  been  shipped  a  working  phone  STI  Mobile  probably  would  have  met  my  needs  , 	0.21875
but  I  was  turned  off  by  the  poor  customer  service 	0.25
and  have  since  found  another  prepaid  phone  provider 	0.25
There  are  many  good  reviews  on  8525  positive  features  and  most  are  fairly  accurate  . 	0.375
Lots  of  good  features  in  the  8525  . 	0.75
My  intent  is  to  document  some 	0.25
of  the  shortcomings  of  the  8525 	0.0001
and  Windows  Mobile  OS  in  the  hope  that  MS  and  HTC  will  heed  and  correct  in  the  future  . 	0.25
I  am  a  business  user 	0.25
who  wanted  to  combine  my  HP  IPAQ  1945  and  my  Motorola  V550  Cell  phone  into  one  device  . 	0.25
I  use  a  Motorola  H700  headset  with  my  old  devices  and  the  8525  . 	0.375
My  overall  assessment  is  ; 	0.25
Replacing  my  two  3  year 	0.0001
old  devices  resulted  in  me  accepting  some  compromises 	0.25
that  I  do  n't  think  are  necessary  in  terms  of  functionality  and  ease  of  use  . 	0.40625
All  the  features  I  describe  below  were  in  the  earlier  Windows  Mobile  OS 	0.25
used  by  my  IPAQ  1945  or  my  Motorola  flip  phone  . 	0.0001
If  readers  find  that  there  is  a  way  to  perform  any  of  the  deficiencies 	0.1875
I  describe  please  let  me  know  . 	0.0001
My  suggestions  in  rough  order  of  priority  : 	0.0001
1  -RRB-  Blue  tooth  headsets  . 	0.0001
Blue  tooth  audio  should  always  come  through  the  blue  tooth  headset  regardless  of  the  PDA  volume  setting  . 	0.0001
To  hear  my  voice  commands  repeated  , 	0.0001
I  have  to  turn  on  the  annoying  sound  of  the  PDA  , 	0.25
so  when  I  voice  dial  via  my  Blue  tooth  headset  , 	0.0001
I  can  hear  my  voice  commands 	0.0001
repeated  back  . 	0.0001
I  am 	0.25
referring  to  the  standard  voice  dial 	0.375
that  comes  with  the  8525  . 	0.0001
One  quick  solution  would  be  to  tie  BT  headset  to  the  phone  volume  setting  rather  than  the  PDA  . 	0.375
Even  nicer  would  be  an  upgrade 	0.4166666666666667
"that  allows  full  audio  with  the  ""  VoiceCommand  ""  software "	0.0001
-LRB-  this  is  documented  in  many  other  reviews  -RRB-  . 	0.16666666666666666
Another  nice  feature  of  my  Motorola  cell  phone  was  as  soon  as  the  BT  was  detected  the  phone  volume 	0.25
changed  from  vibrate 	0.0001
to  audio  if  it  was  set  to  vibrate  . 	0.25
It  changed  back  to  the  original  audio 	0.25
setting  after  turning  off  the  BT  headset  . 	0.0001
1a  -RRB-  If  I  request  voice  dial  via  my  blue  tooth  headset  the  screen  should  ALWAYS  display  the  voice  dial  page  . 	0.125
"Instead  the  initial  ""  Owner  Info  ""  page  stays  up "	0.0001
and  you  ca  n't  see  the  name  on  the  screen  unless  you  reach  down 	0.0001
and  tap  the  screen  . 	0.125
Not  desirable 	0.5
when  driving  . 	0.0001
If  you  did  n't  set  the  PDA  to  its  annoying  noise  level  you  ca  n't  hear  the  name 	0.0001
you  requested 	0.0001
either  . 	0.0001
2  -RRB-  Need 	0.125
to  be  able  to  control  the  PDA  and  phone  volume  independently  for  Audio  ,  Vibrate  or  OFF  . 	0.1875
For  example  need  to  be  able  to  tie  turn  up  the  phone  volume  while  keeping  the  PDA  volume  setting  on  OFF  or  vibrate  . 	0.20833333333333331
3  -RRB-  Need 	0.125
to  be  able 	0.1875
to  program  how  long  the  display  stays  on  . 	0.0001
I  am  constantly  groping  to  find  the  power  button  on  the  side  to  keep  the  display  on  as  it  turns  off 	0.1875
when  I  need 	0.25
to  see  something  . 	0.0001
4  -RRB-  I  would  buy  a  non  Bluetooth  headset  if  one  was  available  for  long  drives 	0.3125
when  my  BT  headset  battery  is  dead  . 	0.25
Only  solution  I  see  is  the  8525  stereo  headphones  and  turning  on  the  speaker 	0.25
which  is  a  little  noisy  for  listeners 	0.3125
while  driving  on  the  freeway  . 	0.375
5  -RRB- 	0.0001
Provide  a  built  in  way  to  make  the  PTT  and  Comm  Manager  , 	0.0001
and  IE  Quick  key  buttons  programmable  . 	0.0001
I  would  use  them  for  many  other  functions  ;  such  as  PTT  bringing  up  the  volume  control 	0.0001
so  I  can  change  it  from  vibrate  to  audio  to  speaker 	0.0001
-LRB-  need  to  be  able  to  select  speaker  here  see  below  -RRB-  . 	0.20833333333333331
6  -RRB-  Give  me  a  way  to  press  an  external  button  to  toggle  between  speaker  on 	0.0001
and  off  . 	0.0001
I  ca  n't  easily  push  the  speaker  icon  with  my  fingers  . 	0.25
Suggestion  . 	0.0001
Add  a  radio  button  on  the  volume  control 	0.625
that  allows  you  to  select  speaker  phone  . 	0.0001
Yes  you  can  select  the  phone  speaker  soft  button  , 	0.25
but  often  the  display  has  gone  blank 	0.25
and  the  keypad  is  showing  . 	0.25
Turning  speaker  on\/off  should  be  easier  . 	0.4375
7  -RRB-  Provide  option  to  save  email  attachments  to  storage  card  . 	0.5
That  was  on  my  IPAQ  Windows  OS 	0.25
and  allowed  me  to  capture  lots  of  attachments  without  running  out  of  memory  . 	0.0001
8  -RRB-  Remember 	0.0001
the  Filter 	0.0001
setting 	0.0001
I  selected  for  Tasks  . 	0.0001
If  I  have  filtered  by  a  task  category 	0.25
during  that  session  remember  the  filter 	0.0001
I  selected  . 	0.0001
Currently  I  have  so  many  tasks 	0.25
there  is  a  5  second  delay  to  bring  them  all  up 	0.25
9  -RRB-  Give  me  a  way  to  turn  off  have  the  Internet  browser 	0.25
Quick  Key 	0.0001
-LRB-  or  make  this  button  programmable  -RRB- 	0.0001
I 	0.0001
am  always  having  to  close  the  browser 	0.25
because  it  gets  hit\/selected 	0.125
10  -RRB-  Let 	0.0001
me  Edit\/Paste  with  one  step  for  notes  ,  word  ,  task  notes  etc  . 	0.0001
"The  IPAQ  has  ""  Edit  "" "	0.25
at  the  bottom  . 	0.0001
With  8525  OS 	0.0001
you  must  select  Menu  , 	0.0001
then  Edit  , 	0.0001
then  Copy  . 	0.0001
Keep  Edit  on  the  bottom  . 	0.0001
Question  : 	0.125
is  there  a  key  on  the  keypad  to  select  CNTRL  C  for  copy  like  what  is  done  on  a  PC 	0.25
-LRB-  the  letters  are  underlined  in  the  menu  ,  but  I  do  n't  see  a  CNTRL  key  on  the  keypad  ? 	0.25
11  -RRB-  Allow  the  trackwheel  to  scroll  up 	0.0001
to  the  icons  on  the  top 	0.0001
and  then  use  the  nav  button  to  move  across  the  icons 	0.0001
-LRB-  might  be  the  way 	0.25
to  allow  an  external  way 	0.0001
to  set  audio  volume  -RRB- 	0.0001
12  -RRB-  If  I  power  off  the  device  have  it  remember  my  input  selection  . 	0.25
For  example 	0.0001
"I  select  ""  Letter  Recognizer  ""  . "	0.0001
But  I  must  reset  each  time  I  power  8525  off  . 	0.0001
I  had  a  Pampered  Chef  sprayer 	0.25
that  I  loved  , 	0.5
but  it  got  clogged  and  stopped  working  after  2  or  3  years  . 	0.125
I  should  have  tried  harder  to  find  a  Pampered  Chef  rep  to  buy  another  one  ,  the  Pampered  Chef  one  works  better  than  this  one  . 	0.5625
However  , 	0.125
this  is  not  a  horrible  product  . 	0.25
One  drawback  compared  to  the  Pampered  Chef  one  is  that  you  ca  n't  see  through  this  one  to  see 	0.3125
how  high  the  oil  level  is  . 	0.1875
You  want  to  fill  it  just  a  bit  higher  than  halfway  , 	0.25
and 	0.0001
when  it  is  less  than  1\/3  full  you  need 	0.25
to  fill  it  back  up  or  it  wo  n't  work  as  well  . 	0.375
This  unit  is  even  more  finicky  than  the  Pampered  Chef  one  about  the  level  , 	0.1875
it  almost  wo  n't  spray  if  the  level  is  too  low  . 	0.1875
But  since  you  ca  n't  see  through  it  , 	0.0001
even  holding  it  up  to  the  light  , 	0.125
you  have  to  look  down  in  and  estimate 	0.25
how  high  it  is  . 	0.1875
The  reflective  coating  inside  makes  it  very  hard  to  see 	0.25
how  high  it  really  is  . 	0.3333333333333333
You  do  n't  want  to  fill  it  all  the  way  up  ,  either  . 	0.25
Then  , 	0.0001
you  need 	0.25
to  pump  it  more 	0.0001
than  the  Pampered  Chef  one  needed  to  be  pumped  . 	0.25
This  one  sprays  a  very  fine  spray  ,  finer  than  the  Pampered  Chef  one  . 	0.25
And  it  sprays  quite  nicely  if  you  have  the  correct  level  of  oil  in  there  . 	0.25
I  think 	0.0001
I  know 	0.0001
why  my  old  one  got  clogged  . 	0.375
So  I  'm  trying  something  new  : 	0.375
each  time  I  'm  done  , 	0.0001
before  I  put  it  away  , 	0.0001
I  twist  the  screw  on  cap  around  the  nozzle 	0.0001
and  release  the  pressure  . 	0.125
I  think 	0.0001
if  you  leave  it  pressured  up  all  the  time  , 	0.375
like  I  did  with  my  old  one  , 	0.375
it  damages  the  nozzle  over  time  . 	0.0001
But  time  will  tell  if  I  'm  right  . 	0.25
Another  tip  --  do  n't  fill  it  with  anything  but  olive  oil  . 	0.0001
Other  oils  evaporate 	0.0001
and  leave  a  sticky\/greasy  feeling  on  the  outside  of  the  sprayer  . 	0.125
You  know 	0.0001
what  I  mean  if  you  use  vegetable  oil  for  stovetop  cooking  a  lot  , 	0.0001
you  get  that  greasy  feeling  on  things  that  you  leave  near  the  stove  or  that  hang  over  it  . 	0.125
Olive  oil  does  n't  do  that  , 	0.0001
that  's  why  I  now  do  n't  use  anything  else  on  my  stovetop 	0.0001
-LRB-  except  sometimes  peanut  oil  for  stir  frying  -RRB-  . 	0.0001
This  type  of  sprayer  will  work  much  better  if  you  just  use  Olive  Oil  in  it  ,  trust  me  . 	0.875
But  if  you  have  a  choice  ,  go  find  a  Pampered  Chef  rep  and  by  their  sprayer  . 	0.4375
It  's  cheaper  and  better  quality 	0.625
I  `  ve  bought  a  number  of  Oxo  kitchen  accessories  ,  and  found  them  to  be  sturdy  ,  remarkably  well  designed  , 	0.2916666666666667
and  easy  to  use  . 	0.625
Unfortunately  ,  this  timer  is  an  exception  . 	0.25
It  has  the  usual  features  typical  of  timers  at  this  price  point  : 	0.16666666666666666
clock  plus  timer  ,  ten  number  keys  for  input  ,  memory  ,  etc  . 	0.0001
But  instead  of  being  flat  with  a  magnet  on  the  back 	0.25
so  it  can  fall  off  the  refrigerator  like  other  timers  , 	0.125
it  's  round  like  a  traditional  wind-up  kitchen  timer  . 	0.0001
It  's  solid-feeling 	0.0001
and  has  nice  non-skid  feet  on  the  bottom  . 	0.5625
The  problem  is  the  display  . 	0.25
It  's  horrible  . 	0.0001
For  three  reasons  : 	0.0001
First  ,  the  numbers  are  small  --  smaller  than  any  other  timer 	0.25
I  `  ve  seen  . 	0.0001
"They  `  re  about  1\/4  ""  high  , "	0.125
half  or  less  the  size  of  those  on  comparable  timers  . 	0.3125
"Second  ,  the  numbers  are  recessed  1\/8  ""  or  more  beneath  a  clear  plastic  cover  ,  not  on  the  surface "	0.375
--  it  's  dark  in  there  and  feels  like  looking  down  a  well  . 	0.20833333333333331
It  desperately  needs  a  backlight  , 	0.1875
but  there  is  none  . 	0.25
Unless  the  light  source  is  shining  directly  into  the  display  , 	0.3125
there  's  a  large  dark  shadow 	0.1875
covering  part  of  the  numbers  . 	0.0001
But  that  causes  the  third  problem  : 	0.0001
The  clear  plastic  cover  over  the  numbers  is  both  curved  and  highly  reflective  , 	0.4375
and  it  's  virtually  impossible  to  arrange  things  so  that  there  is  n't  a  reflection 	0.16666666666666666
shining  back  into  your  eyes  . 	0.4375
The  bottom  line  is  that  I  have  to  fiddle  around  to  get  the  timer  ,  the  light  source  ,  and  myself  into  a  position 	0.20833333333333331
where  I  can  read  the  small  ,  dark  ,  shadowed  , 	0.125
and  reflective  display  . 	0.375
Not  what  I  need 	0.25
