7_gourmet_neg_1	Good black tea is not hard to find - just hard to find in your grocery store .
7_gourmet_neg_2	The honest truth is that Tazo really does not make many , if any really good teas .
7_gourmet_neg_3	This , in particular , is one of their worst .
7_gourmet_neg_4	It is bitter
7_gourmet_neg_5	and leaves a bad taste in your mouth immediately .
7_gourmet_neg_6	Every time i get
7_gourmet_neg_7	stuck in a starbucks with friends
7_gourmet_neg_8	i am faced with the choice - tea , chai or steamed milk .
7_gourmet_neg_9	Every time i cave in
7_gourmet_neg_10	and give Tazo another chance
7_gourmet_neg_11	it disappoints me .
7_gourmet_neg_12	If you want a good black tea look for a local tea shop
7_gourmet_neg_13	and let them brew
7_gourmet_neg_14	you a few cups .
7_gourmet_neg_15	Try a keemun , a lapsang and maybe golden dianhong
7_gourmet_neg_16	and see
7_gourmet_neg_17	how it goes .
7_gourmet_neg_18	If you really want to kick it up a notch look for a
7_gourmet_neg_19	Cameroonian black .
7_gourmet_neg_20	take it from someone
7_gourmet_neg_21	who really loves tea , this stuff is not worth your time .
7_gourmet_neg_22	and when you get good tea ,
7_gourmet_neg_23	please do n't brew it in your coffee maker
