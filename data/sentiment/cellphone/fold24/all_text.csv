4_cell_neg_1	My problems with nextel did not stop
4_cell_neg_2	when I canceled my service .
4_cell_neg_3	I will get to the problems with the service .
4_cell_neg_4	When I went to get a new phone a day
4_cell_neg_5	before my contract expired ,
4_cell_neg_6	I of course wanted to keep my number .
4_cell_neg_7	So as I went to get my Cingular phone
4_cell_neg_8	-LRB- highly recommended -RRB- ,
4_cell_neg_9	I had the old number
4_cell_neg_10	switched to my new number .
4_cell_neg_11	Today ,
4_cell_neg_12	I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $ 200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service ,
4_cell_neg_13	but had simply got a new phone
4_cell_neg_14	and switched my number over .
4_cell_neg_15	This was on icing on the cake
4_cell_neg_16	after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel .
4_cell_neg_17	In my town , not a small town by any means ,
4_cell_neg_18	there are very few places
4_cell_neg_19	that have any service .
4_cell_neg_20	In the largest subdivision ,
4_cell_neg_21	you can not get service anywhere .
4_cell_neg_22	I constantly get comments from people
4_cell_neg_23	trying
4_cell_neg_24	to reach me
4_cell_neg_25	that get the classic nextel line . . .
4_cell_neg_26	Please hold
4_cell_neg_27	while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located .
4_cell_neg_28	Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls , calls would go straight to my voice mail .
4_cell_neg_29	Not only would I not get the calls ,
4_cell_neg_30	but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later .
4_cell_neg_31	When I did actually take calls
4_cell_neg_32	-LRB- and call out -RRB- ,
4_cell_neg_33	I can not count the number of times
4_cell_neg_34	I ` ve had my call
4_cell_neg_35	dropped .
4_cell_neg_36	I recieved so many different error messages sometimes
4_cell_neg_37	I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones .
4_cell_neg_38	That brings
4_cell_neg_39	me to the selling point of nextel , the famed and well-loved direct connect feature .
4_cell_neg_40	This is an absolute joke .
4_cell_neg_41	Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time
4_cell_neg_42	I tried to use it .
4_cell_neg_43	Even then , in the middle of the conversation
4_cell_neg_44	I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone
4_cell_neg_45	telling me
4_cell_neg_46	I wont be talking to that person anymore .
4_cell_neg_47	Of course ,
4_cell_neg_48	I would expect nothing less from the nextel network .
4_cell_neg_49	Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible .
4_cell_neg_50	If it did not take hours
4_cell_neg_51	to send or recieve a message ,
4_cell_neg_52	it took days , or maybe did n't even come at all .
4_cell_neg_53	The internet access was fine ,
4_cell_neg_54	it the rare instance that it worked .
4_cell_neg_55	Of course ,
4_cell_neg_56	when you do n't have service ,
4_cell_neg_57	you do n't get the internet access either .
4_cell_neg_58	"I was constantly getting the message "" network not available "" ."
4_cell_neg_59	Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile .
4_cell_neg_60	Trying to get through to customer service takes forever
4_cell_neg_61	and once you get through they do nothing .
4_cell_neg_62	My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster
4_cell_neg_63	and I write this trying to warn anyone
4_cell_neg_64	considering nextel .
4_cell_neg_65	Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end .
4_cell_neg_66	Do n't make the same mistake
4_cell_neg_67	I did .
