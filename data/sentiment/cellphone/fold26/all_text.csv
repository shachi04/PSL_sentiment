6_cell_neg_1	This review is more about Virgin Mobil customer service than the phone .
6_cell_neg_2	I ordered a VOX 8610 on 1/22/2007 online thru Virgin Mobile .
6_cell_neg_3	The phone would n't charge .
6_cell_neg_4	I called customer service
6_cell_neg_5	and explained the problem .
6_cell_neg_6	They said
6_cell_neg_7	did
6_cell_neg_8	I want a charger or another phone .
6_cell_neg_9	I replied that I could not tell if it was the charger or the phone
6_cell_neg_10	that was at fault so please send a new kit .
6_cell_neg_11	I received a phone
6_cell_neg_12	but not a charger
6_cell_neg_13	and it also would n't charge .
6_cell_neg_14	I called customer service
6_cell_neg_15	and explained
6_cell_neg_16	the issue
6_cell_neg_17	and
6_cell_neg_18	it must be the charger at fault .
6_cell_neg_19	The rep said
6_cell_neg_20	they would not send a new charger ,
6_cell_neg_21	that I would have to purchase one .
6_cell_neg_22	I said
6_cell_neg_23	this did n't make any sense ,
6_cell_neg_24	according to the offer
6_cell_neg_25	I could return the phone for a full refund
6_cell_neg_26	and does that mean
6_cell_neg_27	that to get a new phone
6_cell_neg_28	and charge I need
6_cell_neg_29	to return the phones for a refund
6_cell_neg_30	and then order another one to get a charger ?
6_cell_neg_31	The support rep said
6_cell_neg_32	yes and that I had to make up my mind - either return the phone or purchase a charger .
6_cell_neg_33	I asked to speak to a supervisor .
6_cell_neg_34	The customer support rep kept
6_cell_neg_35	going off line
6_cell_neg_36	-LRB- to talk to someone ? -RRB-
6_cell_neg_37	but refused or could n't get a supervisor
6_cell_neg_38	to talk to me .
6_cell_neg_39	She then asked for the ESN number of the phone .
6_cell_neg_40	When I said
6_cell_neg_41	I did n't know
6_cell_neg_42	what an ' ESN ' number she indignantly explained
6_cell_neg_43	that it was like a serial number on the back of the phone .
6_cell_neg_44	I 'm not clear
6_cell_neg_45	why she needed this ,
6_cell_neg_46	since I have n't activated the phone
6_cell_neg_47	and I already referenced the order
6_cell_neg_48	-LRB- vmu -RRB- number .
6_cell_neg_49	At any rate I had been on the phone now for over 40 min with the support rep
6_cell_neg_50	-LRB- obviously not very cost effective for virgin mobile -RRB-
6_cell_neg_51	and at least she was trying to track down some info - or so I thought - she finally came back on line
6_cell_neg_52	and said
6_cell_neg_53	that the computer was down
6_cell_neg_54	and she could n't handle my order - that I would have to call back .
6_cell_neg_55	I called back , had to work my way
6_cell_neg_56	thru the answering system
6_cell_neg_57	and got thru to RMA and a fellow
6_cell_neg_58	named Mike .
6_cell_neg_59	Mike explained
6_cell_neg_60	that they could n't send a charger
6_cell_neg_61	-LRB- none in stock -RRB-
6_cell_neg_62	and that I would have to send the entire phone back -
6_cell_neg_63	which is what I am now doing -
6_cell_neg_64	60 + minutes after the initial call .
6_cell_neg_65	I have to say
6_cell_neg_66	that my interactions with virgin mobile so far has not been positive .
6_cell_neg_67	They customer service staff is obviously poorly trained and not empowered to make decisions .
6_cell_neg_68	The interfaces with support are youth
6_cell_neg_69	geared - not a bad thing except when it is at the expense of treating adults courteously and professionally .
6_cell_neg_70	I am
6_cell_neg_71	sending the phone back for a refund
6_cell_neg_72	and re-considering the provider for pay-as-you-go service .
6_cell_neg_73	01/26/2007 .
