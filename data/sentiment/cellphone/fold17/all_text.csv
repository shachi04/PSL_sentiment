17_cell_pos_1	This is a great phone
17_cell_pos_2	that I ` ve used for a year
17_cell_pos_3	now .
17_cell_pos_4	I 'd like to highlight the standout features
17_cell_pos_5	that make this phone unique , especially at its price .
17_cell_pos_6	MP3 player .
17_cell_pos_7	Just get an adapter for the usb port
17_cell_pos_8	-LRB- a few bucks on eBay -RRB-
17_cell_pos_9	and
17_cell_pos_10	you can plug in your stereo headphones .
17_cell_pos_11	Too bad they have n't offered an update to the Motorola Digital Audio Player .
17_cell_pos_12	MicroSD slot .
17_cell_pos_13	You can take a MicroSD card , put it into the included adapter
17_cell_pos_14	and plug into an SD slot
17_cell_pos_15	on your computer and copy MP3s
17_cell_pos_16	-LRB- you can take any mp3
17_cell_pos_17	and make it your ringtone ,
17_cell_pos_18	cropping
17_cell_pos_19	it will make
17_cell_pos_20	it more effective -RRB- , 3GP videos
17_cell_pos_21	-LRB- animation looks great ,
17_cell_pos_22	but the sound was slightly out of sync , search the web for video converters to convert your content -RRB- , or pictures .
17_cell_pos_23	I love
17_cell_pos_24	making my own ringtones
17_cell_pos_25	and not having to buy them .
17_cell_pos_26	Bluetooth .
17_cell_pos_27	I got an Explorer 320 headset for $ 20
17_cell_pos_28	and
17_cell_pos_29	it works great with it .
17_cell_pos_30	Battery .
17_cell_pos_31	Easily exchangeable .
17_cell_pos_32	Easily slide off the cover and pop in a fresh one .
17_cell_pos_33	The battery life is n't very long ,
17_cell_pos_34	so it 's good to have a spare battery ,
17_cell_pos_35	they ` re cheap .
17_cell_pos_36	Video camera .
17_cell_pos_37	Not high quality video ,
17_cell_pos_38	but its something the old RAZR could n't do .
17_cell_pos_39	Customization .

17_cell_pos_41	You can set up the hotkey on the side of the phone , the two on the top of the keypad , and the directional pad to go directly to most functions of the phone .
17_cell_pos_42	It even has a shortcut list to list all your favorite features .

17_cell_pos_50	when you ` re put on hold .
17_cell_pos_51	The speaker is loud and great for ringtones and mp3s .
17_cell_pos_52	The plastic may resonate at certain sounds though .
17_cell_pos_53	Vibrating alert .
17_cell_pos_54	VIBE THEN RING !
17_cell_pos_55	Why does n't every phone have this ? ?
17_cell_pos_56	It should be the default standard for all phones .
17_cell_pos_57	The vibration is definitely strong enough to feel in a pocket .
17_cell_pos_58	If you are one
17_cell_pos_59	to show off your ringtone , let
17_cell_pos_60	it move onto ring , otherwise be descreet
17_cell_pos_61	and answer immediately .
17_cell_pos_62	-----------------------------------------------------------
17_cell_pos_63	As for what I do n't like .
17_cell_pos_64	I do n't care much for the Motorola menu style .
17_cell_pos_65	I prefer Sanyo and Samsung interfaces .
17_cell_pos_66	The menu is the same as a RAZR or SLVR .
17_cell_pos_67	All the lettering on the outside as well as some case paint has rubbed off .
17_cell_pos_68	I carry my phone in my pocket so the phone has aged a bit .
17_cell_pos_69	I scraped off the remainder
17_cell_pos_70	of the lettering so it would n't look half
17_cell_pos_71	worn off .
17_cell_pos_72	-----------------------------------------------------------
17_cell_pos_73	All the great features is what keeps me from getting a Samsung t509 or other more expensive phones .
17_cell_pos_74	This phone just has all the fee-free features you could want
