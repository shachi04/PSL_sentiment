7_cell_neg_1	Prior to buying this phone
7_cell_neg_2	I had heard
7_cell_neg_3	a lot of people say
7_cell_neg_4	that Motorola 's hardware was very good ,
7_cell_neg_5	but that their software left a lot to be desired .
7_cell_neg_6	Nonetheless I decided to try this phone out
7_cell_neg_7	when it came time to start a new cell plan .
7_cell_neg_8	I had made the decision
7_cell_neg_9	to switch to T-mobile
7_cell_neg_10	and this looked like one of the best phone options .
7_cell_neg_11	Right off the bat
7_cell_neg_12	I found out
7_cell_neg_13	that the people who criticized Moto 's software were right on the money .
7_cell_neg_14	There are a host of poorly designed software aspects of this phone , not the least of which is the -- frankly -- idiotic way
7_cell_neg_15	the phone book is designed .
7_cell_neg_16	Eventually I made peace with all of the things
7_cell_neg_17	I disliked about the V360 since at least it seemed to work well enough as a phone .
7_cell_neg_18	As time went by I started noticing
7_cell_neg_19	that I was missing a lot of calls .
7_cell_neg_20	The phone would be in my bag or in my pocket or sitting on my desk
7_cell_neg_21	when suddenly it would ring with the voicemail notification from a message that I had received anywhere from minutes
7_cell_neg_22	to hours
7_cell_neg_23	before .
7_cell_neg_24	During the course of the last few months
7_cell_neg_25	-LRB- the phone is less than a year old -RRB-
7_cell_neg_26	I ` ve also found that it has begun
7_cell_neg_27	crashing .
7_cell_neg_28	A lot .
7_cell_neg_29	"Opening or closing it will result in a "" white screen of death . """
7_cell_neg_30	Putting it on the charger will cause it to switch back and forth between the messages that it is charging ,
7_cell_neg_31	that it is unable to charge and that it 's SIM card can not be found ,
7_cell_neg_32	after a few minutes
7_cell_neg_33	of which it will simply shut itself off .
7_cell_neg_34	With a full battery charge it will continually shut itself off .
7_cell_neg_35	At this point I am
7_cell_neg_36	forced to conclude
7_cell_neg_37	that this phone is an absolute piece of junk .
7_cell_neg_38	I am also forced to conclude
7_cell_neg_39	that it is n't the only model
7_cell_neg_40	which is .
7_cell_neg_41	None of my coworkers has ever had a good experience with a Motorola phone .
7_cell_neg_42	My wife 's Motorola has shown its own host of problems .
7_cell_neg_43	People working for T-mobile at several stores
7_cell_neg_44	I have visited have confided
7_cell_neg_45	that they never , ever recommend Motorola phones to anyone .
7_cell_neg_46	In fact
7_cell_neg_47	I ` ve had T-mobile employees urge
7_cell_neg_48	me to not buy any phones from them ,
7_cell_neg_49	but rather to shop for an unlocked Nokia online .
7_cell_neg_50	So that 's what I 'm going to do .
7_cell_neg_51	Until I can buy a new phone
7_cell_neg_52	all I can do is recharge this phone every night , restart it five or six times a day ,
7_cell_neg_53	and keep apologizing to my friends , family and employers for always missing their calls
