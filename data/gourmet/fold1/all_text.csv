1_gourmet_pos_1	Once you see the book
1_gourmet_pos_2	that accompanies this starter kit ,
1_gourmet_pos_3	you will realize two things .
1_gourmet_pos_4	You wo n't be making sushi anytime soon without a few more items .
1_gourmet_pos_5	Not only do
1_gourmet_pos_6	you need fresh ingredients ,
1_gourmet_pos_7	you need things
1_gourmet_pos_8	that are listed in the recipes to make Miso ,
1_gourmet_pos_9	to make Number-one Dashi and Number-two Dashi .
1_gourmet_pos_10	You need Bonito flakes and kombu ,
1_gourmet_pos_11	you need things like bamboo leaves too .
1_gourmet_pos_12	OK ,
1_gourmet_pos_13	so you do n't need bamboo leaves ,
1_gourmet_pos_14	but having a bamboo plant around the house would n't hurt .
1_gourmet_pos_15	The book is especially helpful ,
1_gourmet_pos_16	but to make the sushi rice professionally ,
1_gourmet_pos_17	you do need to also order a rice-cooling tub
1_gourmet_pos_18	-LRB- hangiri -RRB- .
1_gourmet_pos_19	A square omelet pan is needed ,
1_gourmet_pos_20	but not essential .
1_gourmet_pos_21	You can adapt by using a regular pan .
1_gourmet_pos_22	Just add your fresh ingredients is the understatement of the year .
1_gourmet_pos_23	You do get a sushi press , a sushi mat and Nishiki Sushi rice .
1_gourmet_pos_24	The sushi Nori is essential
1_gourmet_pos_25	as is the ginger , wassabi , soy sauce , rice vinegar , sweet wine
1_gourmet_pos_26	-LRB- mirin -RRB-
1_gourmet_pos_27	and white sesame seeds .
1_gourmet_pos_28	Other items you will want to have on hand

1_gourmet_pos_39	Rice Maker

1_gourmet_pos_59	Tofu - various types but Japanese Silken is recommended
1_gourmet_pos_60	Wakame Seaweed
1_gourmet_pos_61	Recommended Seafood selections include :
1_gourmet_pos_62	Mackerel , Salmon ,
1_gourmet_pos_63	Crabs , Blue-Eye Cod , Tuna , Herring , Sea Bass and numerous other selections .
1_gourmet_pos_64	I will be making mine with cooked fish for the most part and many of the recipes indicate
1_gourmet_pos_65	cooking the shrimp .
1_gourmet_pos_66	The book gives excellent full-color picture step-by-step instructions for preparing
1_gourmet_pos_67	seafood .
1_gourmet_pos_68	Everything from cleaning squid to angled cuts for sahimi .
1_gourmet_pos_69	Prepare to learn an ancient art form .
1_gourmet_pos_70	This is serious
1_gourmet_pos_71	cooking with gourmet appeal .
1_gourmet_pos_72	There are instructions for making garnishes and dipping sauces .
1_gourmet_pos_73	The Tuna Rolls are probably going to be one of the first items to make
1_gourmet_pos_74	because they have few ingredients
1_gourmet_pos_75	and you do n't need anything except a rice cooker , sushi vinegar and the rolling mat .
1_gourmet_pos_76	The California-roll-style Temaki-zushi also look fairly tame .
1_gourmet_pos_77	The Nigiri-Zushi
1_gourmet_pos_78	made in sushi bars seem a little more complex .
1_gourmet_pos_79	To make a simple Inari-Zushi
1_gourmet_pos_80	you need tofu
1_gourmet_pos_81	and there are extensive instructions for how to make the little packets or pouches for rice .
1_gourmet_pos_82	These seem very interesting and I ` ve tasted them before
1_gourmet_pos_83	and definitely look forward to trying to make them .
1_gourmet_pos_84	The idea of a Chirashi-Zushi rice bowl is interesting
1_gourmet_pos_85	and does not require a great deal of artistic application .
1_gourmet_pos_86	So ,
1_gourmet_pos_87	if you want to make a full sushi meal ,
1_gourmet_pos_88	it gets a little more complex ,
1_gourmet_pos_89	but you can try out various recipes
1_gourmet_pos_90	"and master the "" dashi """
1_gourmet_pos_91	which is like a fish stock\/soup
1_gourmet_pos_92	made with kombu and bonito flakes .
1_gourmet_pos_93	This knowledge is of course
1_gourmet_pos_94	needed to make the sushi rice ,
1_gourmet_pos_95	which leads me right back to needing a hangiri .
1_gourmet_pos_96	I suppose you can use a glass bowl instead .
1_gourmet_pos_97	This sushi kit is truly only a brief start to an artistic journey .
1_gourmet_pos_98	Even after ordering this you may find you need a few more items
1_gourmet_pos_99	before you can start taking steps in the direction of actually making sushi .
1_gourmet_pos_100	I will report back
1_gourmet_pos_101	as I try various recipes
1_gourmet_pos_102	and all
1_gourmet_pos_103	I can say
1_gourmet_pos_104	is this will require an adventurous spirit and a few more Amazon orders .
1_gourmet_pos_105	Once you have the Sushi book ,
1_gourmet_pos_106	things start to become more clear and you can make a list of things
1_gourmet_pos_107	to order .
