7_cell_neg_1	Prior  to  buying  this  phone 
7_cell_neg_2	I  had  heard 
7_cell_neg_3	a  lot  of  people  say 
7_cell_neg_4	that  Motorola  's  hardware  was  very  good  , 
7_cell_neg_5	but  that  their  software  left  a  lot  to  be  desired  . 
7_cell_neg_6	Nonetheless  I  decided  to  try  this  phone  out 
7_cell_neg_7	when  it  came  time  to  start  a  new  cell  plan  . 
7_cell_neg_8	I  had  made  the  decision 
7_cell_neg_9	to  switch  to  T-mobile 
7_cell_neg_10	and  this  looked  like  one  of  the  best  phone  options  . 
7_cell_neg_11	Right  off  the  bat 
7_cell_neg_12	I  found  out 
7_cell_neg_13	that  the  people  who  criticized  Moto  's  software  were  right  on  the  money  . 
7_cell_neg_14	There  are  a  host  of  poorly  designed  software  aspects  of  this  phone  ,  not  the  least  of  which  is  the  --  frankly  --  idiotic  way 
7_cell_neg_15	the  phone  book  is  designed  . 
7_cell_neg_16	Eventually  I  made  peace  with  all  of  the  things 
7_cell_neg_17	I  disliked  about  the  V360  since  at  least  it  seemed  to  work  well  enough  as  a  phone  . 
7_cell_neg_18	As  time  went  by  I  started  noticing 
7_cell_neg_19	that  I  was  missing  a  lot  of  calls  . 
7_cell_neg_20	The  phone  would  be  in  my  bag  or  in  my  pocket  or  sitting  on  my  desk 
7_cell_neg_21	when  suddenly  it  would  ring  with  the  voicemail  notification  from  a  message  that  I  had  received  anywhere  from  minutes 
7_cell_neg_22	to  hours 
7_cell_neg_23	before  . 
7_cell_neg_24	During  the  course  of  the  last  few  months 
7_cell_neg_25	-LRB-  the  phone  is  less  than  a  year  old  -RRB- 
7_cell_neg_26	I  `  ve  also  found  that  it  has  begun 
7_cell_neg_27	crashing  . 
7_cell_neg_28	A  lot  . 
7_cell_neg_29	"Opening  or  closing  it  will  result  in  a  ""  white  screen  of  death  .  "" "
7_cell_neg_30	Putting  it  on  the  charger  will  cause  it  to  switch  back  and  forth  between  the  messages  that  it  is  charging  , 
7_cell_neg_31	that  it  is  unable  to  charge  and  that  it  's  SIM  card  can  not  be  found  , 
7_cell_neg_32	after  a  few  minutes 
7_cell_neg_33	of  which  it  will  simply  shut  itself  off  . 
7_cell_neg_34	With  a  full  battery  charge  it  will  continually  shut  itself  off  . 
7_cell_neg_35	At  this  point  I  am 
7_cell_neg_36	forced  to  conclude 
7_cell_neg_37	that  this  phone  is  an  absolute  piece  of  junk  . 
7_cell_neg_38	I  am  also  forced  to  conclude 
7_cell_neg_39	that  it  is  n't  the  only  model 
7_cell_neg_40	which  is  . 
7_cell_neg_41	None  of  my  coworkers  has  ever  had  a  good  experience  with  a  Motorola  phone  . 
7_cell_neg_42	My  wife  's  Motorola  has  shown  its  own  host  of  problems  . 
7_cell_neg_43	People  working  for  T-mobile  at  several  stores 
7_cell_neg_44	I  have  visited  have  confided 
7_cell_neg_45	that  they  never  ,  ever  recommend  Motorola  phones  to  anyone  . 
7_cell_neg_46	In  fact 
7_cell_neg_47	I  `  ve  had  T-mobile  employees  urge 
7_cell_neg_48	me  to  not  buy  any  phones  from  them  , 
7_cell_neg_49	but  rather  to  shop  for  an  unlocked  Nokia  online  . 
7_cell_neg_50	So  that  's  what  I  'm  going  to  do  . 
7_cell_neg_51	Until  I  can  buy  a  new  phone 
7_cell_neg_52	all  I  can  do  is  recharge  this  phone  every  night  ,  restart  it  five  or  six  times  a  day  , 
7_cell_neg_53	and  keep  apologizing  to  my  friends  ,  family  and  employers  for  always  missing  their  calls 
18_cell_pos_1	So  I  bought  this  thing 
18_cell_pos_2	based  on  the  Amazon  reviews 
18_cell_pos_3	and  saved  a  bundle  over  the  local  retail  cost 
18_cell_pos_4	-LRB-  yeah  Amazon  !  -RRB-  , 
18_cell_pos_5	but  that  's  not 
18_cell_pos_6	why  I  'm  writing  this  review  . 
18_cell_pos_7	I  'd  like  to  talk  about  the  performance  and  comfort  of  the  Earboom  . 
18_cell_pos_8	The  eargel  thingies  are  designed  quite  well  ,  of  the  three  different  sizes  for  each  ear 
18_cell_pos_9	you  `  re  bound  to  find  one 
18_cell_pos_10	that  fits  very  comfortably  . 
18_cell_pos_11	Turns  out  I  could  n't  find  any 
18_cell_pos_12	that  fit  my  right  ear  comfortably  for  extended  periods  of  use 
18_cell_pos_13	but  found  a  perfect  fit  in  my  mate  on  the  other  side  . 
18_cell_pos_14	My  wife  had  the  exact  opposite  experience  -  hopefully  our  daughter  will  inherit  more  symmetrical  ears  ! 
18_cell_pos_15	I  hate  jogging  so  ca  n't  comment  on  the  fit  during  that  activity 
18_cell_pos_16	but  can  say  the  gels  fit 
18_cell_pos_17	suprising  well  in  the  folds  of  your  ear 
18_cell_pos_18	and  the  boom  is  quite  secure 
18_cell_pos_19	when  installed  . 
18_cell_pos_20	I  'd  have  to  imagine 
18_cell_pos_21	it  'd  take  a  big  hit 
18_cell_pos_22	to  knock  it  loose  once  in  place  . 
18_cell_pos_23	Sound  quality  from  the  earbud  is  decent  , 
18_cell_pos_24	but  I  feel 
18_cell_pos_25	the  Earboom  lacks  some  fidelity  ,  especially  the  higher  frequencies  . 
18_cell_pos_26	Normally  this  is  not  a  problem  , 
18_cell_pos_27	but  it  can  sometimes  make  the  person 
18_cell_pos_28	you  `  re  talking  to  sound  like  Isaac  Hayes  . 
18_cell_pos_29	The  speaker  is  plently  loud  and  the  lack  of  high  frequencies  allows  you  to  tune  into  the  tonal  range 
18_cell_pos_30	where  us  humans  tend  to  converse  , 
18_cell_pos_31	without  having  the  voices 
18_cell_pos_32	washed  over  with  background  noise  . 
18_cell_pos_33	The  gels  block  an  appropriate  amount  of  external  sounds 
18_cell_pos_34	allowing  you  to  concentrate  on  the  discussion  at  hand  without  impeding  your  ability 
18_cell_pos_35	to  hear  say 
18_cell_pos_36	an  ambulance  while  driving  . 
18_cell_pos_37	There  is  a  small  slot  on  the  gels 
18_cell_pos_38	that  funnels  some  external  noise  to  your  drum  , 
18_cell_pos_39	while  the  rest  of  the  gel  fits  snug  to  the  ear 
18_cell_pos_40	blocking  out  other  stray  noise  paths  . 
18_cell_pos_41	I  `  ve  asked  people 
18_cell_pos_42	how  I  sound 
18_cell_pos_43	and  thus  far  the  feedback  has  been  positive  , 
18_cell_pos_44	my  voice  comes  through  loud  and  clear  despite  the  boom  's  apparent  lack  of  length  , 
18_cell_pos_45	reinforcing  my  belief 
18_cell_pos_46	that  size  DOES  N'T  matter  . 
18_cell_pos_47	In  fact  , 
18_cell_pos_48	I  have  found  the  mic  to  be  very  sensitive  to  even  small  sounds  . 
18_cell_pos_49	Forget  talking  on  the  phone 
18_cell_pos_50	and  subtly  typing  on  the  keyboard  our  mouse  click  surfing  - 
18_cell_pos_51	they  `  ll  hear  every  click  . 
18_cell_pos_52	Another  example  , 
18_cell_pos_53	I  was  in  my  house 
18_cell_pos_54	and  the  person  on  the  other  end  could  hear  the  kids 
18_cell_pos_55	playing  in  the  pool  40  feet  away 
18_cell_pos_56	with  the  house  windows  closed  !  ! 
18_cell_pos_57	Yes  ,  the  mic  is  that  sensitive  . 
18_cell_pos_58	Even  while  driving  they  could  hear 
18_cell_pos_59	when  I  shifted  gears  . 
18_cell_pos_60	Not  that  it  's  obtrusive  to  the  other  person  on  the  phone  , 
18_cell_pos_61	it  's  just  good  to  be  aware 
18_cell_pos_62	they  can  hear  it  all  . 
18_cell_pos_63	What  more  to  say  about  such  a  simple  device  . 
18_cell_pos_64	Form  Fit  and  Function  are  all  there  and  I  would  recommend  this  product  . 
18_cell_pos_65	In  fact  , 
18_cell_pos_66	I  just  ordered  another  - 
18_cell_pos_67	it  makes  a  great  gift 
13_kitchen_pos_1	I  have  been  using  a  Chemex  10-cup  coffee  maker  for  several  weeks  and  have  never  had  such  good  coffee  before  in  my  life  . 
13_kitchen_pos_2	I  am  constantly  looking  forward  to  my  next  pot  of  coffee  ! 
13_kitchen_pos_3	There  is  a  downside  to  this  coffee  maker  : 
13_kitchen_pos_4	it  is  a  more  manual  procedure  than  what  you  are  used  to  , 
13_kitchen_pos_5	and  it  also  takes  a  couple  of  pots 
13_kitchen_pos_6	to  learn 
13_kitchen_pos_7	how  to  use  this  most  efficiently  . 
13_kitchen_pos_8	The  first  time  I  tried  to  use  mine  , 
13_kitchen_pos_9	I  had  ground  my  coffee  way  too  finely  and  it  just  took  forever  ! 
13_kitchen_pos_10	The  big  time  consumers  : 
13_kitchen_pos_11	you  have  to  boil  your  water  separately 
13_kitchen_pos_12	-LRB-  you  do  have  a  water  kettle  right  ?  -RRB- 
13_kitchen_pos_13	and  then  you  have  to  gradually  pour  the  boiled  water  through  the  Chemex  . 
13_kitchen_pos_14	This  means  that  while  the  coffee  is  brewing  , 
13_kitchen_pos_15	you  are  pouring  ,  or  watching  ,  or  giving  the  filter  area  a  bit  of  a  stir  . 
13_kitchen_pos_16	Now  the  up  side  : 
13_kitchen_pos_17	you  will  never  ever  ever  drink  a  better  cup  of  coffee  . 
13_kitchen_pos_18	I  use  filtered  water  ,  freshly  ground  home  roasted  beans  ,  and  this  Chemex  to  produce  the  finest  coffee 
13_kitchen_pos_19	I  have  ever  had  the  pleasure  of  drinking  . 
13_kitchen_pos_20	And  this  coffee  is  a  pleasure  ! 
13_kitchen_pos_21	In  fact  , 
13_kitchen_pos_22	I  `  ve  totally  given  up  using  cream  and  sugar 
13_kitchen_pos_23	because  my  coffee  no  longer  has  anything  to  hide  . 
13_kitchen_pos_24	Another  up  side  : 
13_kitchen_pos_25	clean  up  means 
13_kitchen_pos_26	swishing  the  Chemex  with  warm  water 
13_kitchen_pos_27	and  tossing  the  water  down  the  drain  . 
13_kitchen_pos_28	You  can  also  wash  with  a  bottle  brush 
13_kitchen_pos_29	but  this  is  rarely  necessary  . 
13_kitchen_pos_30	A  brief  swish  is  really  all 
13_kitchen_pos_31	it  takes  to  get  your  Chemex 
13_kitchen_pos_32	looking  factory  new  . 
13_kitchen_pos_33	Try  that  with  your  electric  drip  machine  ! 
13_kitchen_pos_34	Ha  !  That  thing  will  NEVER  look  brand  new  ! 
13_kitchen_pos_35	Oh  ,  here  's  a  final  upside  : 
13_kitchen_pos_36	this  Chemex  brews  the  best  coffee 
13_kitchen_pos_37	you  `  ll  ever  drink  , 
13_kitchen_pos_38	and  it  costs  less  than  just  about  anything  . 
13_kitchen_pos_39	You  are  probably  already  spending  more  money  than  this  every  month  at  Starbucks  ! 
13_kitchen_pos_40	Go  ahead 
13_kitchen_pos_41	and  buy  yourself  one  of  these  . 
13_kitchen_pos_42	If  necessary  ,  wake  up  10  minutes  earlier  to  make  your  coffee  . 
13_kitchen_pos_43	Better  yet  ,  wake  up  20  minutes  earlier  . 
13_kitchen_pos_44	And 
13_kitchen_pos_45	when  your  coffee  is  ready  ,  instead  of  dumping  it  into  a  travel  cup 
13_kitchen_pos_46	and  bolting  out  the  door  ,  sit  down 
13_kitchen_pos_47	and  enjoy  your  first  cup  for  the  next  10  minutes  . 
13_kitchen_pos_48	You  deserve  it  ! 
13_kitchen_pos_49	UPDATE  : 
13_kitchen_pos_50	It  's  been  a  year  now 
13_kitchen_pos_51	and  I  still  love  this  Chemex  . 
13_kitchen_pos_52	However  ,  over  time  the  glass  acquired  a  coffee  color  tinge 
13_kitchen_pos_53	that  gradually  became  darker  with  each  use  . 
13_kitchen_pos_54	Nothing  I  tried  got  it  clean  , 
13_kitchen_pos_55	but  something  my  wife  tried  did  : 
13_kitchen_pos_56	a  splash  of  bleach  in  otherwise  clean  water 
13_kitchen_pos_57	followed  by  a  thorough  swishing  . 
13_kitchen_pos_58	Now  my  Chemex 
13_kitchen_pos_59	looks  brand  new 
6_kitchen_neg_1	My  wife  bought  this  one  from  Best  Buy  without  me  reviewing 
6_kitchen_neg_2	it  1st  . 
6_kitchen_neg_3	Amazingly  , 
6_kitchen_neg_4	I  would  have  bought  it  after  reading  the  reviews  here  . 
6_kitchen_neg_5	I  'm  starting  to  wonder 
6_kitchen_neg_6	who  writes  these  things  .  .  . 
6_kitchen_neg_7	LG  employees  ? 
6_kitchen_neg_8	The  microwave  is  fine  -  no  complaints  . 
6_kitchen_neg_9	The  toaster  ,  however  ,  is  an  unmitigated  disaster  . 
6_kitchen_neg_10	I  am  of  the  opinion  that  you  should  rarely  combine  appliances 
6_kitchen_neg_11	-  this  appliance  is  a  poster  child  for  this  thought  . 
6_kitchen_neg_12	The  toaster  browns  extremely  unevenly  and  inconsistently 
6_kitchen_neg_13	-LRB-  sometimes  you  should  toast  the  same  piece  of  bread  on  5 
6_kitchen_neg_14	and  sometimes  as  high  as  10  !  -RRB-  . 
6_kitchen_neg_15	More  importantly  ,  the  toaster  broke 
6_kitchen_neg_16	after  31  days 
6_kitchen_neg_17	-LRB-  coincidently  the  Best  Buy  return  policy 
6_kitchen_neg_18	ends  at  the  same  time  - 
6_kitchen_neg_19	Best  Buy  has  an  unacceptable  return  policy 
6_kitchen_neg_20	"but  with  a  guy  named  ""  Ricky  "" "
6_kitchen_neg_21	managing  the  store 
6_kitchen_neg_22	what  can  you  expect  ?  -RRB-  . 
6_kitchen_neg_23	LG  picks  up  the  phone  quickly 
6_kitchen_neg_24	and  they  honor  the  warranty  . 
6_kitchen_neg_25	The  problem  is  they  ca  n't  think  outside  of  the  box  . 
6_kitchen_neg_26	They  had  me  get  it  repaired 
6_kitchen_neg_27	but  I  have  to  inconveniently  drive  it  out  there 
6_kitchen_neg_28	and  pick  it  up  -  OK  .  .  . 
6_kitchen_neg_29	no  problem  . 
6_kitchen_neg_30	One  day  later  ? 
6_kitchen_neg_31	It  breaks  again  . 
6_kitchen_neg_32	It  is  an  extremely  poorly  built  appliance  and  the  repair  people  thought 
6_kitchen_neg_33	they  had  fixed  it 
6_kitchen_neg_34	and  had  not  . 
6_kitchen_neg_35	That  's  how  bad  it  was  . 
6_kitchen_neg_36	LG  will  not  budge  -  have 
6_kitchen_neg_37	it  repaired  again 
6_kitchen_neg_38	-LRB-  great  option  -  costs  LG  money  , 
6_kitchen_neg_39	me  more  travel  time  , 
6_kitchen_neg_40	and  it  wo  n't  do  the  job  -RRB- 
6_kitchen_neg_41	or  do  a  rebate  . 
6_kitchen_neg_42	The  rebate  requires  me  to  buy  another  LG  or  Goldstar  product  . 
6_kitchen_neg_43	Huh  ? 
6_kitchen_neg_44	So  you  create  a  shoddy  product 
6_kitchen_neg_45	and  rush  it  to  the  marketplace 
6_kitchen_neg_46	-LRB-  they  admitted 
6_kitchen_neg_47	they  do  n't  have  a  detailed  enough  repair  history 
6_kitchen_neg_48	because  it  is  too  new  -RRB- 
6_kitchen_neg_49	and  then  do  n't  stand  behind  your  product  . 
6_kitchen_neg_50	You  backend 
6_kitchen_neg_51	me  into  another  LG  or  Goldstar  product  that  I  would  not  have  otherwise  bought  . 
6_kitchen_neg_52	How  does  our  government  allow  these  atrocious  foreign  companies  to  business  here  ? 
6_kitchen_neg_53	Our  we  so  bad  as  a  manufacturer 
6_kitchen_neg_54	that  we  ca  n't  top  this  ? 
6_kitchen_neg_55	Their  supervisors  were  very  hardlined  and  there  was  no 
6_kitchen_neg_56	getting  around  this  . 
6_kitchen_neg_57	You  can  cal  Korea 
6_kitchen_neg_58	"but  they  wo  n't  change  their  policy  "" "
6_kitchen_neg_59	they  said  . 
6_kitchen_neg_60	I  will  never  willingly  buy  another  LG  or  Goldstar  product 
6_kitchen_neg_61	and  I  highly  recommend 
6_kitchen_neg_62	you  do  the  same  . 
6_kitchen_neg_63	Shame  on  you  LG  -  you  could  have  had  me  as  an  appliance  buyer  for  the  next  50  years 
6_kitchen_neg_64	and  now  your  name  is  mud  to  me 
1_gourmet_pos_1	Once  you  see  the  book 
1_gourmet_pos_2	that  accompanies  this  starter  kit  , 
1_gourmet_pos_3	you  will  realize  two  things  . 
1_gourmet_pos_4	You  wo  n't  be  making  sushi  anytime  soon  without  a  few  more  items  . 
1_gourmet_pos_5	Not  only  do 
1_gourmet_pos_6	you  need  fresh  ingredients  , 
1_gourmet_pos_7	you  need  things 
1_gourmet_pos_8	that  are  listed  in  the  recipes  to  make  Miso  , 
1_gourmet_pos_9	to  make  Number-one  Dashi  and  Number-two  Dashi  . 
1_gourmet_pos_10	You  need  Bonito  flakes  and  kombu  , 
1_gourmet_pos_11	you  need  things  like  bamboo  leaves  too  . 
1_gourmet_pos_12	OK  , 
1_gourmet_pos_13	so  you  do  n't  need  bamboo  leaves  , 
1_gourmet_pos_14	but  having  a  bamboo  plant  around  the  house  would  n't  hurt  . 
1_gourmet_pos_15	The  book  is  especially  helpful  , 
1_gourmet_pos_16	but  to  make  the  sushi  rice  professionally  , 
1_gourmet_pos_17	you  do  need  to  also  order  a  rice-cooling  tub 
1_gourmet_pos_18	-LRB-  hangiri  -RRB-  . 
1_gourmet_pos_19	A  square  omelet  pan  is  needed  , 
1_gourmet_pos_20	but  not  essential  . 
1_gourmet_pos_21	You  can  adapt  by  using  a  regular  pan  . 
1_gourmet_pos_22	Just  add  your  fresh  ingredients  is  the  understatement  of  the  year  . 
1_gourmet_pos_23	You  do  get  a  sushi  press  ,  a  sushi  mat  and  Nishiki  Sushi  rice  . 
1_gourmet_pos_24	The  sushi  Nori  is  essential 
1_gourmet_pos_25	as  is  the  ginger  ,  wassabi  ,  soy  sauce  ,  rice  vinegar  ,  sweet  wine 
1_gourmet_pos_26	-LRB-  mirin  -RRB- 
1_gourmet_pos_27	and  white  sesame  seeds  . 
1_gourmet_pos_28	Other  items  you  will  want  to  have  on  hand 
1_gourmet_pos_29	when  this  arrives  : 
1_gourmet_pos_30	Chopsticks 
1_gourmet_pos_31	Ginger  Grater 
1_gourmet_pos_32	Chopping  Board 
1_gourmet_pos_33	Fish  Knives 
1_gourmet_pos_34	-LRB-  sushi  knives  -RRB- 
1_gourmet_pos_35	Plates  for  serving  Sushi 
1_gourmet_pos_36	-LRB-  not  essential  but  make 
1_gourmet_pos_37	it  more  interesting  -RRB- 
1_gourmet_pos_38	Skewers  -  for  when  you  cook  shrimp 
1_gourmet_pos_39	Rice  Maker 
1_gourmet_pos_40	Stainless  Steel  Colander 
1_gourmet_pos_41	Wooden  Rice  Paddle  -  or  you  can  use  a  wooden  spoon 
1_gourmet_pos_42	Ingredients  :

1_gourmet_pos_63	Crabs  ,  Blue-Eye  Cod  ,  Tuna  ,  Herring  ,  Sea  Bass  and  numerous  other  selections  . 
1_gourmet_pos_64	I  will  be  making  mine  with  cooked  fish  for  the  most  part  and  many  of  the  recipes  indicate 
1_gourmet_pos_65	cooking  the  shrimp  . 
1_gourmet_pos_66	The  book  gives  excellent  full-color  picture  step-by-step  instructions  for  preparing 
1_gourmet_pos_67	seafood  . 
1_gourmet_pos_68	Everything  from  cleaning  squid  to  angled  cuts  for  sahimi  . 
1_gourmet_pos_69	Prepare  to  learn  an  ancient  art  form  . 
1_gourmet_pos_70	This  is  serious 
1_gourmet_pos_71	cooking  with  gourmet  appeal  . 
1_gourmet_pos_72	There  are  instructions  for  making  garnishes  and  dipping  sauces  . 
1_gourmet_pos_73	The  Tuna  Rolls  are  probably  going  to  be  one  of  the  first  items  to  make 
1_gourmet_pos_74	because  they  have  few  ingredients 
1_gourmet_pos_75	and  you  do  n't  need  anything  except  a  rice  cooker  ,  sushi  vinegar  and  the  rolling  mat  . 
1_gourmet_pos_76	The  California-roll-style  Temaki-zushi  also  look  fairly  tame  . 
1_gourmet_pos_77	The  Nigiri-Zushi 
1_gourmet_pos_78	made  in  sushi  bars  seem  a  little  more  complex  . 
1_gourmet_pos_79	To  make  a  simple  Inari-Zushi 
1_gourmet_pos_80	you  need  tofu 
1_gourmet_pos_81	and  there  are  extensive  instructions  for  how  to  make  the  little  packets  or  pouches  for  rice  . 
1_gourmet_pos_82	These  seem  very  interesting  and  I  `  ve  tasted  them  before 
1_gourmet_pos_83	and  definitely  look  forward  to  trying  to  make  them  . 
1_gourmet_pos_84	The  idea  of  a  Chirashi-Zushi  rice  bowl  is  interesting 
1_gourmet_pos_85	and  does  not  require  a  great  deal  of  artistic  application  . 
1_gourmet_pos_86	So  , 
1_gourmet_pos_87	if  you  want  to  make  a  full  sushi  meal  , 
1_gourmet_pos_88	it  gets  a  little  more  complex  , 
1_gourmet_pos_89	but  you  can  try  out  various  recipes 
1_gourmet_pos_90	"and  master  the  ""  dashi  "" "
1_gourmet_pos_91	which  is  like  a  fish  stock\/soup 
1_gourmet_pos_92	made  with  kombu  and  bonito  flakes  . 
1_gourmet_pos_93	This  knowledge  is  of  course 
1_gourmet_pos_94	needed  to  make  the  sushi  rice  , 
1_gourmet_pos_95	which  leads  me  right  back  to  needing  a  hangiri  . 
1_gourmet_pos_96	I  suppose  you  can  use  a  glass  bowl  instead  . 
1_gourmet_pos_97	This  sushi  kit  is  truly  only  a  brief  start  to  an  artistic  journey  . 
1_gourmet_pos_98	Even  after  ordering  this  you  may  find  you  need  a  few  more  items 
1_gourmet_pos_99	before  you  can  start  taking  steps  in  the  direction  of  actually  making  sushi  . 
1_gourmet_pos_100	I  will  report  back 
1_gourmet_pos_101	as  I  try  various  recipes 
1_gourmet_pos_102	and  all 
1_gourmet_pos_103	I  can  say 
1_gourmet_pos_104	is  this  will  require  an  adventurous  spirit  and  a  few  more  Amazon  orders  . 
1_gourmet_pos_105	Once  you  have  the  Sushi  book  , 
1_gourmet_pos_106	things  start  to  become  more  clear  and  you  can  make  a  list  of  things 
1_gourmet_pos_107	to  order  . 
1_gourmet_pos_108	~  The  Rebecca  Review 
15_gourmet_neg_1	As  a  vegan  , 
15_gourmet_neg_2	I  have  tried  just  about  every  tofu  product  on  the  market  ,  and  nothing  ever  came  close  to  the  terrible  texture  of  these  noodles  . 
15_gourmet_neg_3	The  smell 
15_gourmet_neg_4	when  you  opened  the  bag  was  not  pleasant  , 
15_gourmet_neg_5	but  if  you  wash  them  off 
15_gourmet_neg_6	and  parboil  , 
15_gourmet_neg_7	that  goes  away  , 
15_gourmet_neg_8	but  is  replaced  with  a  slightly  sweet  smell  that  I  disliked  almost  as  much  . 
15_gourmet_neg_9	But  I  kept  an  open  mind  , 
15_gourmet_neg_10	cooked  the  noodles  for  a  few  minutes  ,  added  my  favorite  sauce  and  fresh  ground  pepper  with  some  soy  cheese 
15_gourmet_neg_11	grated  on  top  . 
15_gourmet_neg_12	Whoever  said 
15_gourmet_neg_13	it  was  like  eating  rubber  bands  was  exactly  on  target  , 
15_gourmet_neg_14	they  are  incredibly  chewy  and  just  do  n't  taste  that  great  either  . 
15_gourmet_neg_15	Even  as  a  low  calorie  food  , 
15_gourmet_neg_16	it  seems  like  a  waste 
15_gourmet_neg_17	to  spend  40  calories  on  these  noodles  . 
15_cell_neg_1	I  got  this  phone  basically  for  free  , 
15_cell_neg_2	but  even  taking  that  into  account  , 
15_cell_neg_3	I  'm  pretty  disappointed  with  the  phone  . 
15_cell_neg_4	This  is  my  first  Samsung 
15_cell_neg_5	and  , 
15_cell_neg_6	I  'm  pretty  sure  ,  my  last  one  ! 
15_cell_neg_7	I  owned  a  Nokia  before 
15_cell_neg_8	and  I  regret 
15_cell_neg_9	"that  I  ""  betrayed  "" "
15_cell_neg_10	it  . 
15_cell_neg_11	From  now  I  would  n't  get  anything  besides  Nokia  and  in  the  worst  case  maybe  Sony-Ericsson  . 
15_cell_neg_12	"So  here  is  a  short  list  of  those  ""  little  things  "" "
15_cell_neg_13	that  make  your  life  ,  with  this  phone 
15_cell_neg_14	-LRB-  and  it  's  combination  with  T-Mobile  -RRB-  , 
15_cell_neg_15	annoying  : 
15_cell_neg_16	-  the  keys  are  not  comfortable  to  use  . 
15_cell_neg_17	-  it  's  not  really  comfortable  to  open\/close  the  slider 
15_cell_neg_18	and  to  make 
15_cell_neg_19	it  easier 
15_cell_neg_20	you  have  to  put  your  thumb  on  the  screen 
15_cell_neg_21	which  leaves  is  greasy  all  the  time  . 
15_cell_neg_22	-  putting  a  comma  , 
15_cell_neg_23	while  writing  a  text  message  ,  capitalizes  the  next  word  - 
15_cell_neg_24	what  is  the  logic  in  that  ?  ! 
15_cell_neg_25	-LRB-  it  annoys  me 
15_cell_neg_26	because  i  do  use  text  messages  a  lot  -RRB- 
15_cell_neg_27	-  you  ca  n't  set  the  camera  shutter  to  be  silent  .  .  . 
15_cell_neg_28	-  you  can  only  save  1  phone  type  for  each  category  - 
15_cell_neg_29	what  if  the  person  has  2  business  phones  .  .  . 
15_cell_neg_30	-  you  can  not  choose  the  e-mail  address  of  a  person  from  the  contact  list 
15_cell_neg_31	when  you  want  to  send  a  picture  message  to  an  e-mail  address  . 
15_cell_neg_32	And  there  is  a  lot  more  of  those  little  illogical  things 
15_cell_neg_33	that  were  just  not  thought  through  , 
15_cell_neg_34	like  it  would  `  ve  been  in  a  Nokia 
15_cell_neg_35	-LRB-  even  in  a  model  5  years  old  !  -RRB- 
15_cell_neg_36	Oh  yeah  , 
15_cell_neg_37	"and  T-Mobile  really  ""  contributed  ""  to  the  ""  greatness  "" "
15_cell_neg_38	of  this  phone  , 
15_cell_neg_39	removing  some  of  the  features  and  limiting  others  ,  like  setting  your  mp3  as  a  ringtone 
15_cell_neg_40	-LRB-  although  ,  there  is  an  easy  hack  around  it  : 
15_cell_neg_41	just  change  the  extension  from  .  mp3  to  .3  gp 
1_cell_pos_1	I  think  this  is  a  pretty  good  earpiece  .  .  . 
1_cell_pos_2	granted  , 
1_cell_pos_3	I  `  ve  only  used  one  other 
1_cell_pos_4	-LRB-  it  was  a  flimsy  little  thing 
1_cell_pos_5	that  came  w  \/  my  friend  's  Nokia  -RRB-  , 
1_cell_pos_6	but  this  one  far  surpasses  that  one  in  sound  quality  and  comfort  . 
1_cell_pos_7	Where  my  friend  's  would  fall  out  of  my  ear  ,  this  one 
1_cell_pos_8	-LRB-  once  I  got 
1_cell_pos_9	it  figured  out  -RRB- 
1_cell_pos_10	never  comes  loose  . 
1_cell_pos_11	Second  , 
1_cell_pos_12	listening  to  people  on  my  friend  's  , 
1_cell_pos_13	I  would  have  to  turn  up  the  sound  to  hear  the  person  well  , 
1_cell_pos_14	and  then  they  sounded  muffled  and  distorted  ; 
1_cell_pos_15	but  on  my  Jabra 
1_cell_pos_16	I  can  actually  turn  down  the  volume  on  my  phone 
1_cell_pos_17	and  they  sound  crisp  and  clear  --  moreso  than  when  I  'm  not  using  the  earpiece  . 
1_cell_pos_18	Finally  , 
1_cell_pos_19	when  my  friend  calls  me 
1_cell_pos_20	and  uses  her  earpiece  , 
1_cell_pos_21	she  sounds  distant 
1_cell_pos_22	and  muffled  ; 
1_cell_pos_23	I  `  ve  had  no  complaints  from  the  people 
1_cell_pos_24	I  'm  talking  to  using  the  Jabra  , 
1_cell_pos_25	and  , 
1_cell_pos_26	in  fact  , 
1_cell_pos_27	my  mom  said 
1_cell_pos_28	it  sounds  better 
1_cell_pos_29	when  I  use  the  EarBoom  than  when  I  do  n't  . 
1_cell_pos_30	The  ear  gels  are  a  bit  hard  to  get 
1_cell_pos_31	used  to  . 
1_cell_pos_32	They  are  oddly  shaped 
1_cell_pos_33	-LRB- 
1_cell_pos_34	as  you  can  see  in  the  picture  -RRB-  , 
1_cell_pos_35	and  there  are  six  of  them  total  --  three  of  them  for  each  ear  . 
1_cell_pos_36	Lots  of  reviewers  complained  about  the  fit  and  comfort  of  the  ear  gels  , 
1_cell_pos_37	while  others  claim 
1_cell_pos_38	these  are  the  most  comfortable  earpieces 
1_cell_pos_39	they  `  ve  used  and  that  they  fit  perfectly  .  .  . 
1_cell_pos_40	I  can  honesly  say 
1_cell_pos_41	I  `  ve  had  both  experiences  . 
1_cell_pos_42	When  I  first  got  this  unit  the  earpiece  kept  falling  out  everytime 
1_cell_pos_43	that  I  would  turn  my  head  : 
1_cell_pos_44	\*  very  \*  frustrating  . 
1_cell_pos_45	I  tried 
1_cell_pos_46	pushing  it  into  my  ear  as  hard  as  I  could  , 
1_cell_pos_47	I  tried 
1_cell_pos_48	holding  it  in  place  with  my  hand  ,  but  that  only  seemed  to  defeat  the  purpose  of  having  a  hands-free  earpiece  . 
1_cell_pos_49	Nothing  seemed  to  work  . 
1_cell_pos_50	I  was  thinking  of  returning  it  . 
1_cell_pos_51	I  was  thinking  of  throwing  it  into  traffic  on  I-95  . 
1_cell_pos_52	And  then  one  day  ,  somehow  ,  I  came  to  the  realization  that  you  have  to  sort  of  twist  it  into  your  ear  --  with  the  little  poky-out  part  stuck  in  the  fold  of  your  ear  next  to  the  ear  canal 
1_cell_pos_53	-LRB-  not  the  fold  on  the  top  of  your  ear  ; 
1_cell_pos_54	if  you  do 
1_cell_pos_55	that  it  `  ll  just  pop  out  again  -RRB-  -- 
1_cell_pos_56	and  then  \*  voila  \*  it  stays  put  . 
1_cell_pos_57	Matter  o  '  fact  , 
1_cell_pos_58	it  `  ll  stay  put  so  well  that  it  `  ll  be  a  little  bit  difficult 
1_cell_pos_59	--  even  \*  painful  \*  -- 
1_cell_pos_60	to  get  out  again  . 
1_cell_pos_61	I  can  imagine  that  people  with  different  ear  sizes  ,  different  patience  levels  ,  and  lower  IQs  might  have  different  experiences  than  my  own  . 
1_cell_pos_62	But  all  I  can  say  is  that  once  I  had  this  little  bugger 
1_cell_pos_63	figured  out  , 
1_cell_pos_64	I  was  golden  . 
1_cell_pos_65	I  love  this  thing 
1_cell_pos_66	and  almost  never  talk  on  the  phone  without  it  . 
1_cell_pos_67	Admittedly  , 
1_cell_pos_68	it  is  a  bit  difficult  to  get  into  your  ear  -- 
1_cell_pos_69	I  'd  say 
1_cell_pos_70	it  takes  upward  of  2  seconds  to  get  in  properly 
1_cell_pos_71	-LRB-  before  you  `  re  good  and  practiced  at  it  -RRB-  , 
1_cell_pos_72	which  may  not  sound  like  a  lot  , 
1_cell_pos_73	but  it  's  long  enough 
1_cell_pos_74	to  not  recognize  somebody  's  voice  or  hear  the  first  sentence  they  say  ,  or  whatever  . 
1_cell_pos_75	A  \*  very  mild  \*  frustration  . 
1_cell_pos_76	But  like  all  things  good  and  pleasant  , 
1_cell_pos_77	it  takes  a  little  practice 
1_cell_pos_78	to  get  it  just  right  and  now  I  have  it  so  that  I  can  answer  the  phone  ,  slip  the  EarBoom  in  my  ear 
1_cell_pos_79	and  start  a  conversation 
1_cell_pos_80	without  missing  a  beat  . 
1_cell_pos_81	In  fact  ,  I  find  this  earpiece  to  be  so  comfortable 
1_cell_pos_82	that  I  forget 
1_cell_pos_83	that  it  's  in  until  I  go  to  scratch  my  ear  or  something  ! 
1_cell_pos_84	The  other  complaint  that  I  saw  on  here  was  that  it  's  not  compatible  with  Nokia  phones  . 
1_cell_pos_85	In  fact  , 
1_cell_pos_86	it  even  says 
1_cell_pos_87	right 
1_cell_pos_88	on  the  package  that  it  's  not  compatible  with  Nokia  . 
1_cell_pos_89	That  's  funny  , 
1_cell_pos_90	I  have  a  Nokia  3589i 
1_cell_pos_91	and  it  works  just  fine  . 
1_cell_pos_92	They  make  two  other  models  of  EarBoom 
1_cell_pos_93	-LRB-  one  of  which  clearly  would  not  have  worked  with  my  phone  -RRB-  , 
1_cell_pos_94	both  of  which  claim  to  be  Nokia  compatible  , 
1_cell_pos_95	and  \*  neither  \*  of  those  works  with  my  phone  ! 
1_cell_pos_96	Confusing  ? 
1_cell_pos_97	Yes  ! 
1_cell_pos_98	The  problem  is  it  does  n't  work  with  \*  all  \*  Nokia  phones  . 
1_cell_pos_99	While  browsing  at  the  store 
1_cell_pos_100	I  noticed  that  the  ones 
1_cell_pos_101	that  claimed  to  be  Nokia  compatible  had  a  list  of  phones 
1_cell_pos_102	that  it  works  with  , 
1_cell_pos_103	but  it  did  n't  include  mine 
1_cell_pos_104	-LRB-  it  included  one 
1_cell_pos_105	that  was  ,  numerically  speaking  ,  very  close  to  my  model  : 
1_cell_pos_106	the  3590  -RRB-  ; 
1_cell_pos_107	which  piqued  my  curiosity  . 
1_cell_pos_108	And  so  I  went  to  the  friendly  manager  of  the  store  that  I  was  in  and  he  opened  two  of  the  different  packages  for  me 
1_cell_pos_109	and  let 
1_cell_pos_110	me  test  both  of  them  . 
1_cell_pos_111	One  of  them  worked  ,  the  other  did  n't  . 
1_cell_pos_112	The  strange  part  of  it  was  that  we  could  n't  see  a  visible  difference  in  the  two  units  .  .  . 
1_cell_pos_113	and  then  one  of  us  noticed  that  on  one  of  them  the  jack  had  two  small  black  stripes  around  it 
1_cell_pos_114	-LRB-  that  's  this  one  ,  and  if  you  look  closely  at  the  picture 
1_cell_pos_115	you  can  see  them  -RRB-  , 
1_cell_pos_116	while  the  other  one 
1_cell_pos_117	-LRB-  the  one  marked  as  Nokia  compatible  -RRB- 
1_cell_pos_118	had  three  . 
1_cell_pos_119	Hmmm  .  .  . 
1_cell_pos_120	Curious  . 
1_cell_pos_121	So  my  advice  is  to  either  know  your  phone  well 
1_cell_pos_122	-LRB-  as  in  ,  have  the  little  book  handy  -RRB- 
1_cell_pos_123	or  ask  for  help 
1_cell_pos_124	before  purchasing  . 
1_cell_pos_125	All  in  all  4  of  5  stars  . 
1_cell_pos_126	I  'd  give  it  5  stars  on  performance  and  comfort  , 
1_cell_pos_127	but  have  to  take  it  down  a  notch  for  an  extended  period  of  getting  used  to  it  and  for  confusing  packaging  . 
1_cell_pos_128	Addendum  : 
1_cell_pos_129	Several  months  later  the  little  piece  of  foam  has  fallen  from  the  end  of  the  boom  so  that  any  sound  from  the  wind  becomes  almost  unbearably  loud  for  the  person  at  the  other  end  .  .  . 
1_cell_pos_130	And  living  in  windy  Providence  , 
1_cell_pos_131	this  is  a  bit  of  an  annoyance  . 
1_cell_pos_132	Also  ,  for  a  while 
1_cell_pos_133	I  was  having  a  problem 
1_cell_pos_134	where  the  earpiece  would  cut  out  for  seconds  at  a  time  so  that  I  could  n't  hear  the  person  on  the  other  end  of  the  line 
1_cell_pos_135	-LRB-  and  ,  likewise  , 
1_cell_pos_136	they  could  n't  hear  me  -RRB- 
1_cell_pos_137	unless  I  jiggled  the  little  jack  . 
1_cell_pos_138	This  was  \*  very  \*  FRUSTRATING  . 
1_cell_pos_139	\*\* 
1_cell_pos_140	Now  ,  for  some  reason  , 
1_cell_pos_141	I  'm  not  having  that  problem  anymore  . 
1_cell_pos_142	I  'm  not  really  sure  if  the  problem  was  due  to  my  phone  or  the  EarBoom  . 
1_cell_pos_143	Either  way  ,  it  's  something  buyers  should  be  aware  of 
15_kitchen_pos_1	After  3  -1  \/  2  years  of  pulling  4  to  8  shots  of  expresso  per  day  , 
15_kitchen_pos_2	and  steaming  hundreds  of  gallons  of  delicious  foamy  milk  , 
15_kitchen_pos_3	this  little  steam  toy  still  works  like  new  . 
15_kitchen_pos_4	Better  than  new  ,  actually  , 
15_kitchen_pos_5	because  it  has  a  better  operator  . 
15_kitchen_pos_6	Good  results  require 
15_kitchen_pos_7	a  bit  of  experimentation  with  the  variables  of  different  grinds  and  quantities  of  coffee 
15_kitchen_pos_8	and  durations  of  extraction  . 
15_kitchen_pos_9	I  `  ve  come  home  many  times  to  discover 
15_kitchen_pos_10	that  I  'd 
15_kitchen_pos_11	left  the  electric  switch  on  all  day  ,  but  not  to  fear  , 
15_kitchen_pos_12	the  thing  does  n't  burn  up  ,  so  far  . 
15_kitchen_pos_13	On  other  occasions  , 
15_kitchen_pos_14	I  `  ve  overloaded  the  pump  by  letting  the  reservoir  run  dry 
15_kitchen_pos_15	and  then  adding  water 
15_kitchen_pos_16	to  try  to  resume  extraction  through  a  filter 
15_kitchen_pos_17	that  had  become  clogged  from  the  interruption  of  the  flow  of  water  . 
15_kitchen_pos_18	The  pump  keeps 
15_kitchen_pos_19	going  even  with  the  output 
15_kitchen_pos_20	blocked  down  to  a  trickle  . 
15_kitchen_pos_21	This  will  happen  to  you 
15_kitchen_pos_22	from  time  to  time 
15_kitchen_pos_23	because  you  will  neglect  to  refill  the  reservoir  . 
15_kitchen_pos_24	When  it  happens  ,  just  start  over  with  dry  coffee  . 
15_kitchen_pos_25	You  will  also  need  to  buy  a  small  diameter  tamper  - 
15_kitchen_pos_26	mine  is  49mm  . 
15_kitchen_pos_27	The  expresso  liquor  always  has  crema 
15_kitchen_pos_28	and  never  tastes  sour  to  me  , 
15_kitchen_pos_29	even  when  using  cheap  brands  of  dark  roast  like  Eight  O  Clock  and  Community  Coffee  . 
15_kitchen_pos_30	Everything  I  `  ve  said 
15_kitchen_pos_31	about  the  brilliance  of  this  machine  is  contingent  ,  howver  ,  on  the  coffee  grinder  . 
15_kitchen_pos_32	Without  a  good  grinder  , 
15_kitchen_pos_33	you  might  as  well  just  make  drip  coffee  . 
15_kitchen_pos_34	The  secret  good  expresso  ,  in  my  experience  ,  is  25  %  expresso  machine  and  75  %  grinder  . 
15_kitchen_pos_35	A  good  grinder  is  the  Gaggia  , 
15_kitchen_pos_36	which  I  bought  from  amazon  for  $  175  with  a  discount  ,  or  the  Rancillio  Rocky  , 
15_kitchen_pos_37	which  I  would  have  gotten  in  the  first  place  had  I  understood  the  importance  of  an  excellent  grinder  . 
15_kitchen_pos_38	This  machine  is  small  and  light  enough 
15_kitchen_pos_39	to  take  with  you 
15_kitchen_pos_40	to  the  motel 
15_kitchen_pos_41	when  you  `  re  on  a  road  trip  ,  and  cheap  enough 
15_kitchen_pos_42	to  leave  behind  if  you  forget  to  put  it  in  your  car  the  next  morning  . 
15_kitchen_pos_43	My  next  expresso  machine  will  be  much  more  expensive  , 
15_kitchen_pos_44	but  not 
15_kitchen_pos_45	because  I  'm  trying  to  obtain  a  higher  quality  brew  . 
15_kitchen_pos_46	My  only  reasons  for  paying  more  are  to  get  double  shots  and  the  solenoid  valve  , 
15_kitchen_pos_47	which  will  eliminate  the  spills 
15_kitchen_pos_48	of  hot  soupy  grounds 
15_kitchen_pos_49	when  emptying  the  porta-filter  . 
15_kitchen_pos_50	Also  , 
15_kitchen_pos_51	when  you  get  familiar  with  the  operation  of  a  machine  , 
15_kitchen_pos_52	you  'd  like  it  to  last  so  you  do  n't  have  to  learn  a  new  set  of  techniques 
18_kitchen_neg_1	"Do  not  be  tricked  into  buying  an  ""  easy  ""  sharpener  . "
18_kitchen_neg_2	They  DO  NOT  work  . 
18_kitchen_neg_3	Spend  the  same  money 
18_kitchen_neg_4	-LRB-  or  less  !  -RRB- 
18_kitchen_neg_5	on  a  good  stone  set  that  has  various  angles 
18_kitchen_neg_6	-LRB-  i.  e  .  Lansky  ,  w  \/  17  ,  20  ,  25  ,  and  30  degree  angles  , 
18_kitchen_neg_7	and  3-5  stones  : 
18_kitchen_neg_8	"use  20  degrees  for  your  ""  slicing  "" "
18_kitchen_neg_9	and  paring  knives  , 
18_kitchen_neg_10	and  25  degrees  for  you 
18_kitchen_neg_11	chefs  -RRB-  . 
18_kitchen_neg_12	I  opted  for  the  stone  set 
18_kitchen_neg_13	-LRB-  I  'm  a  bit  of  a  purist  -RRB-  , 
18_kitchen_neg_14	but  I  `  ve  heard  good  remarks  about  the  diamond  set  ,  too  ; 
18_kitchen_neg_15	the  3  grit  set  is  all 
18_kitchen_neg_16	you  really  need  : 
18_kitchen_neg_17	coarse  ,  medium  ,  and  fine  -  get  the  ultra  fine  if  your  sharpening  razors  and  such  . 
18_kitchen_neg_18	With  proper  care  ,  and  light  steel  use 
18_kitchen_neg_19	-LRB-  it  's  the  re-aligning  tool  ,  not  the  sharpening  device  -  be  gentle  -RRB-  , 
18_kitchen_neg_20	you  `  ll  probably  only  need  to  touch-up  your  edge 
18_kitchen_neg_21	once  every  year  or  two  , 
18_kitchen_neg_22	depending  on  the  work  load  you  put  on  your  knife  . 
18_kitchen_neg_23	But  , 
18_kitchen_neg_24	if  you  do  seriously  muck  the  edge  up  , 
18_kitchen_neg_25	you  `  ll  have  a  system 
18_kitchen_neg_26	"that  can  repair  your  knife  to  ""  good  as  new  ""  condition  . "
18_kitchen_neg_27	My  chef  fell  onto  the  tile  floor  ,  point  first  , 
18_kitchen_neg_28	and  I  had  a  wonderfully  sharpened  instrument  30  minutes  later  . 
18_kitchen_neg_29	The  normal  touch-up  takes  less  than  5  minutes  per  blade  . 
18_kitchen_neg_30	And  , 
18_kitchen_neg_31	at  thirty  dollars 
18_kitchen_neg_32	to  have  5  knives  professionally  sharpened  , 
18_kitchen_neg_33	you  `  ll  be  ahead  of  the  game 
18_kitchen_neg_34	after  the  first  use  ! 
18_kitchen_neg_35	Hint  : 
18_kitchen_neg_36	use  a  5X  +  magnifying  glass\/loupe  to  inspect  your  edge  -  by  carefully  rolling  the  knife 
18_kitchen_neg_37	to  catch  a  bright  light  source  , 
18_kitchen_neg_38	you  `  ll  be  able  to  see  shiny  spots 
18_kitchen_neg_39	where  the  edge  still  needs  to  be  sharpened  . 
18_kitchen_neg_40	You  can  also  take  a  look  at  your  edge 
18_kitchen_neg_41	before  using  the  steel  , 
18_kitchen_neg_42	and  see 
18_kitchen_neg_43	how  bad  you  roll  the  edge 
18_kitchen_neg_44	while  working  with  it  , 
18_kitchen_neg_45	then  see 
18_kitchen_neg_46	how  it  becomes  magically  aligned  after  the  use  of  the  steel  . 
18_kitchen_neg_47	And  ,  see  chips  and  voids  in  your  lower  quality  steel  knives  - 
18_kitchen_neg_48	I  admit  I  have  a  couple  , 
18_kitchen_neg_49	myself  . 
18_kitchen_neg_50	In  short  : 
18_kitchen_neg_51	get 
18_kitchen_neg_52	stoned  , 
18_kitchen_neg_53	not 
18_kitchen_neg_54	taken 
15_gourmet_pos_1	Try  something  different  . 
15_gourmet_pos_2	Forget  microwave  popcorn  for  a  few  weeks  and  try  this  four-pack  just  once  . 
15_gourmet_pos_3	At  the  very  least  , 
15_gourmet_pos_4	you  `  ll  have  a  new  food  experience  , 
15_gourmet_pos_5	but  what  you  might  get  is  a  new  family  tradition  . 
15_gourmet_pos_6	It  's  worth  it  . 
15_gourmet_pos_7	My  wife  and  I  received  a  four-pack  of  Fireworks  Popcorn  last  year  with  these  four  flavors  , 
15_gourmet_pos_8	and  because  we  are  huge  fans  of  stovetop-popping  popcorn  , 
15_gourmet_pos_9	it  was  a  definite  treat  . 
15_gourmet_pos_10	We  love 
15_gourmet_pos_11	watching  movies  , 
15_gourmet_pos_12	and  it  's  a  weekend  tradition  to  make  a  giant  tub  of  popcorn  and  jump  on  the  couch  . 
15_gourmet_pos_13	This  4-pack  is  a  fantastic  way  to  discover  the  differences  in  types  of  popcorn  , 
15_gourmet_pos_14	and  there  really  are  subtle  differences  . 
15_gourmet_pos_15	There  is  a  description  of  the  flavor  on  each  bottle  ,  and  the  bottles  also  tell  you  about  the  size  and  robustness  of  the  finished  product  . 
15_gourmet_pos_16	As  gourmet  as  any  other  gourmet  popcorn  I  `  ve  ever  tried  , 
15_gourmet_pos_17	the  kernels  pop  up  nice  and  big  and  almost  every  kernel  pops  . 
15_gourmet_pos_18	The  flavors  augment  a  good  low-fat  butter  spray  if  that  's  your  fancy  . 
15_gourmet_pos_19	I  'm  very  much  looking  forward  to  receiving  the  8-flavor  sampler  ! 
15_gourmet_pos_20	Personally  , 
15_gourmet_pos_21	I  pop  mine  in  olive  oil  with  a  few  dashes  of  garlic-infused  oil  and\/or  the  red  spicy  olive  oil  and  a  little  salt  . 
15_gourmet_pos_22	That  is  something 
15_gourmet_pos_23	you  ca  n't  do  in  a  microwave  ! 
15_gourmet_pos_24	If  you  `  ve  never  popped  popcorn  on  a  stove 
15_gourmet_pos_25	before 
15_gourmet_pos_26	and  you  `  re  intimidated  .  .  . 
15_gourmet_pos_27	no  worries  . 
15_gourmet_pos_28	Pour  in  enough  popcorn  to  cover  the  bottom  of  the  pot  , 
15_gourmet_pos_29	add  enough  olive  oil  cover  up  about  half  the  height  of  the  kernels  ,  shake  it  over  the  heat  until  the  popping  almost  stops  , 
15_gourmet_pos_30	and  pour  out  the  popcorn  into  a  bowl  asap  . 
15_gourmet_pos_31	Practice  makes  perfect  , 
15_gourmet_pos_32	and  you  do  n't  need  much  practice  at  all  .  .  . 
15_gourmet_pos_33	maybe  just  one  try  ! 
15_gourmet_pos_34	Honestly  ,  for  the  labor  of  about  90  seconds  on  the  stove  and  one  pot  to  wash  , 
15_gourmet_pos_35	you  turn  an  evening  of  TV-viewing  or  movie  watching  into  an  event  . 
15_gourmet_pos_36	The  kids  will  love  it  , 
15_gourmet_pos_37	and  as  a  grown-up  kid  , 
15_gourmet_pos_38	I  highly  recommend  it  . 
15_gourmet_pos_39	I  have  fond  memories 
15_gourmet_pos_40	of  my  dad 
15_gourmet_pos_41	making  popcorn  for  the  three  kids  on  Saturday  nights  , 
15_gourmet_pos_42	and  this  is  a  good  product  to  make  those  memories 
14_gourmet_neg_1	As  a  vegan  , 
14_gourmet_neg_2	I  have  tried  just  about  every  tofu  product  on  the  market  ,  and  nothing  ever  came  close  to  the  terrible  texture  of  these  noodles  . 
14_gourmet_neg_3	The  smell 
14_gourmet_neg_4	when  you  opened  the  bag  was  not  pleasant  , 
14_gourmet_neg_5	but  if  you  wash  them  off 
14_gourmet_neg_6	and  parboil  , 
14_gourmet_neg_7	that  goes  away  , 
14_gourmet_neg_8	but  is  replaced  with  a  slightly  sweet  smell  that  I  disliked  almost  as  much  . 
14_gourmet_neg_9	But  I  kept  an  open  mind  , 
14_gourmet_neg_10	cooked  the  noodles  for  a  few  minutes  ,  added  my  favorite  sauce  and  fresh  ground  pepper  with  some  soy  cheese 
14_gourmet_neg_11	grated  on  top  . 
14_gourmet_neg_12	Whoever  said 
14_gourmet_neg_13	it  was  like  eating  rubber  bands  was  exactly  on  target  , 
14_gourmet_neg_14	they  are  incredibly  chewy  and  just  do  n't  taste  that  great  either  . 
14_gourmet_neg_15	Even  as  a  low  calorie  food  , 
14_gourmet_neg_16	it  seems  like  a  waste 
14_gourmet_neg_17	to  spend  40  calories  on  these  noodles  .
