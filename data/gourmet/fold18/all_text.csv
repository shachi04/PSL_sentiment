18_gourmet_pos_1	I ` ve been ruling Adab , the biggest little city-state in Sumeria , for almost . . .
18_gourmet_pos_2	Has it been 70 years ?
18_gourmet_pos_3	Wow ,
18_gourmet_pos_4	it just seems like yesterday Mesh-Ki-Ang-Nanna was vanquished
18_gourmet_pos_5	and the kingship was taken from Urim .
18_gourmet_pos_6	LOL .
18_gourmet_pos_7	Anyways , due to my hectic schedule of riding through the streets ,
18_gourmet_pos_8	standing atop my jeweled chariot
18_gourmet_pos_9	pulled by a team of grunting oxen on my way
18_gourmet_pos_10	to the ziggurat ,
18_gourmet_pos_11	I barely have time to be fed anymore .
18_gourmet_pos_12	It 's not as if I can be expected to munch on a wieldy leg of lamb during my morning full body shave .
18_gourmet_pos_13	But then one day a traveler who I had commanded to bring back the finest exoticities from the farthest ends of our flat disc , came to me with a handful of small round pellets .
18_gourmet_pos_14	"He called them "" California Red Seedless Grapes "" ."
18_gourmet_pos_15	I had him immediately put to death for reciting words
18_gourmet_pos_16	I had never heard before ,
18_gourmet_pos_17	but I was intrigued .
18_gourmet_pos_18	And would n't you know it ,
18_gourmet_pos_19	but during my afternoon copulation with two dozen virgins , these grapes were exactly what I needed .
18_gourmet_pos_20	I was able to do my usual defiling
18_gourmet_pos_21	of whomever
18_gourmet_pos_22	I choosed and yet due to the curious vine these pellets hung upon , never
18_gourmet_pos_23	once was I unable to calm my disgustingly bloated belly .
18_gourmet_pos_24	And did I mention the taste ?
18_gourmet_pos_25	IMHO ,
18_gourmet_pos_26	It 's like a glorious gift from Enlil that both An and Ki have given their blessing to , with the bonus of no seeds .
18_gourmet_pos_27	I mean seriously , our Gods are truly seers of all to know
18_gourmet_pos_28	that I 'm no fan of seeds .
18_gourmet_pos_29	But in conclusion
18_gourmet_pos_30	while I still do n't know
18_gourmet_pos_31	"where this "" California """
18_gourmet_pos_32	is ,
18_gourmet_pos_33	I know
18_gourmet_pos_34	that they have a wonderful fruit ,
18_gourmet_pos_35	and I hope that soon we conquer them .
18_gourmet_pos_36	I also hope they have virgins .
18_gourmet_pos_37	Also since I 'm already here ,
18_gourmet_pos_38	you guys heard the one about the three ox-drivers from Adab ?
18_gourmet_pos_39	You know ,
18_gourmet_pos_40	"where the punchline is "" With elaborate words , with elaborate words , the case of the citizens of Adab was settled ."
18_gourmet_pos_41	Pa-nijin-jara ,
18_gourmet_pos_42	"their sage , the scholar , the god of Adab , was the scribe . "" ?"
18_gourmet_pos_43	LMAO ,
18_gourmet_pos_44	that gets me every time
