11_cell_neg_1	 Purchased  this  phone  as  an  upgrade  from  the  i530  , 
11_cell_neg_2	 which  I  loved  . 
11_cell_neg_3	 I  was  at  the  end  of  a  2  year  contract  ,  and  felt  that  I  would  get  something  with  a  few  more  bells  and  whistles  -  and  was  excited  about  the  color  screen  with  the  icons  . 
11_cell_neg_4	 Two  of  my  family  members  have  higher  end  Nextels  and  all  work  well  . 
11_cell_neg_5	 I  would  have  purchased  one  of  those  , 
11_cell_neg_6	 except  I  did  n't  really  care  about  a  camera  for  my  phone  , 
11_cell_neg_7	 and  this  one  was  reasonably  priced  .  .  . 
11_cell_neg_8	 and  I  found  out 
11_cell_neg_9	 you  get 
11_cell_neg_10	 what  you  pay  for  ! 
11_cell_neg_11	 The  i560  felt  almost  cheap  in  construction 
11_cell_neg_12	 compared  to  the  i750  ,  i870  and  even  my  old  i530  . 
11_cell_neg_13	 I  had  it  for  a  couple  of  weeks 
11_cell_neg_14	 when  I  started  having  trouble  with  the  clarity  of  my  calls  - 
11_cell_neg_15	 I  could  hear  them  , 
11_cell_neg_16	 but  they  could  n't  hear  me  . 
11_cell_neg_17	 A  couple  of  times  , 
11_cell_neg_18	 I  had  the  screen  go  to  Airplane  Mode  , 
11_cell_neg_19	 even  when  I  had  n't  touched  it  . 
11_cell_neg_20	 The  fact  that  you  had  to  take  the  whole  phone  out 
11_cell_neg_21	 to  see 
11_cell_neg_22	 who  is  calling  was  another  downside  ,  too  . 
11_cell_neg_23	 My  previous  phone  had  to  be  flipped  open  to  see 
11_cell_neg_24	 who  was  calling  , 
11_cell_neg_25	 but  I  had  a  holster 
11_cell_neg_26	 that  could  hold  the  phone  without  disengaging  it  . 
11_cell_neg_27	 Not  a  great  design  for  this  holster  . 
11_cell_neg_28	 Another  problem  is  with  the  power  supply  . 
11_cell_neg_29	 When  charging  the  phone  , 
11_cell_neg_30	 it  is  especially  important  to  make  sure  the  plug  is  seated  tight  -  and  to  check 
11_cell_neg_31	 that  is  says  device 
11_cell_neg_32	 attached  - 
11_cell_neg_33	 it  comes  out  easy 
11_cell_neg_34	 and  stops  charging 
11_cell_neg_35	even
11_cell_neg_36	 when  it  appears  to  be  plugged  into  the  phone  correctly  . 
11_cell_neg_37	 Then  I  am  on  a  phone  call  on  speakerphone 
11_cell_neg_38	 and  the  whole  speaker  just  stops  working  . 
11_cell_neg_39	 Living  in  California  apparently  gives  us  an  advantage  -  30  day  risk  free  guarantee  . 
11_cell_neg_40	 Fortunately  , 
11_cell_neg_41	 we  were  on  day  12  , 
11_cell_neg_42	and
11_cell_neg_43	 after  54  minutes  ,  one  accidental  disconnection  by  Nextel 
11_cell_neg_44	 and  6  customer  service  agents  , 
11_cell_neg_45	 I  finally  received  a  return  authorization 
11_cell_neg_46	 and  placed  a  new  order  . 
11_cell_neg_47	 Terrible  ,  terrible  phone  . 
11_cell_neg_48	 Stay  away  from  it  . 
11_cell_neg_49	 Hoping  the  new  one  on  it  's  way  works  much  better  ! 
11_cell_neg_50	Michell
13_cell_neg_1	 After  owning  3  Blackberry  's  over  the  years  , 
13_cell_neg_2	 I  made  the  switch  to  the  BlackJack  because  of  the  camera  and  the  ability  to  add  memory  . 
13_cell_neg_3	 Compared  to  the  Blackberry  ,  the  Microsoft  operating  system  is  very  cumbersome 
13_cell_neg_4	 -LRB-  for  me  -RRB- 
13_cell_neg_5	 and  was  somewhat  frustrating  to  set  up  initially  . 
13_cell_neg_6	 On  the  plus  side  , 
13_cell_neg_7	 the  Blackjack  has  good  battery  life  , 
13_cell_neg_8	 the  screen  is  excellent 
13_cell_neg_9	 and  it  has  the  best  reception 
13_cell_neg_10	 I  `  ve  ever  experienced  . 
13_cell_neg_11	 The  reason  I  only  gave  the  phone  2  stars  is  because  after  just  3  months  of  moderate  use  the  ink 
13_cell_neg_12	 -LRB-  ie  : 
13_cell_neg_13	 the  numbers  -RRB- 
13_cell_neg_14	began
13_cell_neg_15	 wearing  off  the  keys  . 
13_cell_neg_16	 It  's  to  the  point  now  where  the  phone  is  pretty  much  unusable  , 
13_cell_neg_17	especially
13_cell_neg_18	 when  it  's  backlit  . 
13_cell_neg_19	 I  called  Cingular  first  , 
13_cell_neg_20	 who  passed  me  on  the  Samsung 
13_cell_neg_21	 where  ,  after  2  hours  on  the  phone  , 
13_cell_neg_22	 I  was  told 
13_cell_neg_23	 that  my  only  option  was  to  send  the  phone  -LRB-  my  primary  source  of  communication  -RRB- 
13_cell_neg_24	 to  their  service  center 
13_cell_neg_25	 and  wait  3  weeks  . 
13_cell_neg_26	 To  my  surprise  , 
13_cell_neg_27	 they  went  on  to  say 
13_cell_neg_28	 that  ,  at  their  discretion  , 
13_cell_neg_29	 they  might  also  charge  me  for  the  repair  . 
13_cell_neg_30	 I  `  ve  read  comments  on  these  reviews  were  people 
13_cell_neg_31	 complained  about  service 
13_cell_neg_32	 and  I  always  just  assumed 
13_cell_neg_33	 they  were  exaggerating 
13_cell_neg_34	 but  now  that  I  `  ve  encountered  this  , 
13_cell_neg_35	 I  do  feel 
13_cell_neg_36	 it  's  worth 
13_cell_neg_37	 considering  . 
13_cell_neg_38	 If  you  `  re  thinking  about  a  Blackjack  , 
13_cell_neg_39	 I  encourage  you  to  be  aware 
13_cell_neg_40	 that  ,  for  one  ,  the  ink  may  inexplicably  wear  off  the  keys  , 
13_cell_neg_41	 and  , 
13_cell_neg_42	 that  you  may  well  be  on  your  own 
13_cell_neg_43	 when  it  comes  to  service  . 
13_cell_neg_44	 I  feel  that  it  's  reasonable  to  expect  a  device  as  expensive 
13_cell_neg_45	 as  this  to  remain  functional  for  at  least  3  months  and  if  not  ,  the  company  who  sold  it  should  assume  responsibility  for  making  it  right  . 
19_cell_pos_1	 So  I  bought  this  thing 
19_cell_pos_2	 based  on  the  Amazon  reviews 
19_cell_pos_3	 and  saved  a  bundle  over  the  local  retail  cost 
19_cell_pos_4	 -LRB-  yeah  Amazon  !  -RRB-  , 
19_cell_pos_5	 but  that  's  not 
19_cell_pos_6	 why  I  'm  writing  this  review  . 
19_cell_pos_7	 I  'd  like  to  talk  about  the  performance  and  comfort  of  the  Earboom  . 
19_cell_pos_8	 The  eargel  thingies  are  designed  quite  well  ,  of  the  three  different  sizes  for  each  ear 
19_cell_pos_9	 you  `  re  bound  to  find  one 
19_cell_pos_10	 that  fits  very  comfortably  . 
19_cell_pos_11	 Turns  out  I  could  n't  find  any 
19_cell_pos_12	 that  fit  my  right  ear  comfortably  for  extended  periods  of  use 
19_cell_pos_13	 but  found  a  perfect  fit  in  my  mate  on  the  other  side  . 
19_cell_pos_14	 My  wife  had  the  exact  opposite  experience  -  hopefully  our  daughter  will  inherit  more  symmetrical  ears  ! 
19_cell_pos_15	 I  hate  jogging  so  ca  n't  comment  on  the  fit  during  that  activity 
19_cell_pos_16	 but  can  say  the  gels  fit 
19_cell_pos_17	 suprising  well  in  the  folds  of  your  ear 
19_cell_pos_18	 and  the  boom  is  quite  secure 
19_cell_pos_19	 when  installed  . 
19_cell_pos_20	 I  'd  have  to  imagine 
19_cell_pos_21	 it  'd  take  a  big  hit 
19_cell_pos_22	 to  knock  it  loose  once  in  place  . 
19_cell_pos_23	 Sound  quality  from  the  earbud  is  decent  , 
19_cell_pos_24	 but  I  feel 
19_cell_pos_25	 the  Earboom  lacks  some  fidelity  ,  especially  the  higher  frequencies  . 
19_cell_pos_26	 Normally  this  is  not  a  problem  , 
19_cell_pos_27	 but  it  can  sometimes  make  the  person 
19_cell_pos_28	 you  `  re  talking  to  sound  like  Isaac  Hayes  . 
19_cell_pos_29	 The  speaker  is  plently  loud  and  the  lack  of  high  frequencies  allows  you  to  tune  into  the  tonal  range 
19_cell_pos_30	 where  us  humans  tend  to  converse  , 
19_cell_pos_31	 without  having  the  voices 
19_cell_pos_32	 washed  over  with  background  noise  . 
19_cell_pos_33	 The  gels  block  an  appropriate  amount  of  external  sounds 
19_cell_pos_34	 allowing  you  to  concentrate  on  the  discussion  at  hand  without  impeding  your  ability 
19_cell_pos_35	 to  hear  say 
19_cell_pos_36	 an  ambulance  while  driving  . 
19_cell_pos_37	 There  is  a  small  slot  on  the  gels 
19_cell_pos_38	 that  funnels  some  external  noise  to  your  drum  , 
19_cell_pos_39	 while  the  rest  of  the  gel  fits  snug  to  the  ear 
19_cell_pos_40	 blocking  out  other  stray  noise  paths  . 
19_cell_pos_41	 I  `  ve  asked  people 
19_cell_pos_42	 how  I  sound 
19_cell_pos_43	 and  thus  far  the  feedback  has  been  positive  , 
19_cell_pos_44	 my  voice  comes  through  loud  and  clear  despite  the  boom  's  apparent  lack  of  length  , 
19_cell_pos_45	 reinforcing  my  belief 
19_cell_pos_46	 that  size  DOES  N'T  matter  . 
19_cell_pos_47	 In  fact  , 
19_cell_pos_48	 I  have  found  the  mic  to  be  very  sensitive  to  even  small  sounds  . 
19_cell_pos_49	 Forget  talking  on  the  phone 
19_cell_pos_50	 and  subtly  typing  on  the  keyboard  our  mouse  click  surfing  - 
19_cell_pos_51	 they  `  ll  hear  every  click  . 
19_cell_pos_52	 Another  example  , 
19_cell_pos_53	 I  was  in  my  house 
19_cell_pos_54	 and  the  person  on  the  other  end  could  hear  the  kids 
19_cell_pos_55	 playing  in  the  pool  40  feet  away 
19_cell_pos_56	 with  the  house  windows  closed  !  ! 
19_cell_pos_57	 Yes  ,  the  mic  is  that  sensitive  . 
19_cell_pos_58	 Even  while  driving  they  could  hear 
19_cell_pos_59	 when  I  shifted  gears  . 
19_cell_pos_60	 Not  that  it  's  obtrusive  to  the  other  person  on  the  phone  , 
19_cell_pos_61	 it  's  just  good  to  be  aware 
19_cell_pos_62	 they  can  hear  it  all  . 
19_cell_pos_63	 What  more  to  say  about  such  a  simple  device  . 
19_cell_pos_64	 Form  Fit  and  Function  are  all  there  and  I  would  recommend  this  product  . 
19_cell_pos_65	 In  fact  , 
19_cell_pos_66	 I  just  ordered  another  - 
19_cell_pos_67	 it  makes  a  great  gift 
6_cell_pos_1	 Two  week  review 
6_cell_pos_2	 I  got  this  phone  to  use  as  a  phone 
6_cell_pos_3	 and  am  very  happy  with  it  . 
6_cell_pos_4	 I  have  had  it  about  two  weeks  now  so  this  is  the  early  review  . 
6_cell_pos_5	 First  ,  the  qualifier  . 
6_cell_pos_6	 I  have  a  nice  canon  camera 
6_cell_pos_7	 and  do  n't  want  to  use  my  phone 
6_cell_pos_8	 to  take  pictures  . 
6_cell_pos_9	 I  do  n't  want  to  use  my  phone 
6_cell_pos_10	 to  listen  to  music  or  surf  the  internet  either  , 
6_cell_pos_11	 I  just  want  it  to  make  and  receive  calls  and  maybe  a  text  here  and  there  . 
6_cell_pos_12	 If  you  are  one  of  those  people 
6_cell_pos_13	 that  has  a  different  agenda  for  your  phone  , 
6_cell_pos_14	 then  this  is  probably  not  the  phone  for  you  . 
6_cell_pos_15	 The  Good 
6_cell_pos_16	 Size  is  great  . 
6_cell_pos_17	 This  phone  is  comparable  to  a  Hershey  bar  in  thickness  and  width  , 
6_cell_pos_18	 but  shorter  . 
6_cell_pos_19	 It  fits  in  my  pants  or  shirt  pocket  without  feeling  bulky  . 
6_cell_pos_20	 It  makes  a  razr  feel  thick  , 
6_cell_pos_21	 but  I  am  guessing 
6_cell_pos_22	 it  is  comparable  to  a  slvr  . 
6_cell_pos_23	 The  Slice  has  good  sound  quality  for  such  a  small  phone  . 
6_cell_pos_24	 It  also  has  good  reception  . 
6_cell_pos_25	 Sprints  network  is  not  the  best  in  my  area  , 
6_cell_pos_26	 but  my  slice  has  been  able  to  connect 
6_cell_pos_27	 wherever  I  am  and  maintains  a  strong  connection  even  with  1  bar  . 
6_cell_pos_28	 When  I  was  in  the  car  ,  the  road  noise  got  too  loud  to  hear  , 
6_cell_pos_29	but
6_cell_pos_30	 when  I  hit  the  speakerphone  button 
6_cell_pos_31	 I  could  hear  fine  , 
6_cell_pos_32	 and  keep  my  hands  on  the  wheel  . 
6_cell_pos_33	 Virgin  is  definitely  the  most  affordable  option  if  you  are  not  planning  to  use  the  phone  a  lot  . 
6_cell_pos_34	 I  expect  to  spend  between  $  150  and  $  200  this  first  year  , 
6_cell_pos_35	 including  the  $  50  up  front  for  the  phone  . 
6_cell_pos_36	 The  cheapest  monthly  plan  on  the  big  carriers  would  cost  me  at  least  500  over  a  the  same  period  with  local  taxes 
6_cell_pos_37	 and  fees  included  . 
6_cell_pos_38	 Although  I  have  n't  tried  them  , 
6_cell_pos_39	 it  looks  like  the  monthly  plans  with  Virgin  are  pretty  reasonable  too  if  I  start 
6_cell_pos_40	 getting  into  that  kind  of  usage  level  . 
6_cell_pos_41	 Many  of  the  other  Virgin  phones  look  like  toys  . 
6_cell_pos_42	 Although  this  ones  name  sounds  like  a  toy  and  people  under  18  recognize  it  , 
6_cell_pos_43	 it  also  looks  like  a  real  piece  of  equipment  . 
6_cell_pos_44	 As  an  older  professional  I  am  not  embarrassed  to  plop  this  phone  on  the  conference  table  in  a  meeting  with  the  VP  . 
6_cell_pos_45	 -LRB-  in  vibrate  mode  of  course  -RRB- 
6_cell_pos_46	 At  the  same  time  ,  my  12  year  old  is  hoping 
6_cell_pos_47	 I  hate  it 
6_cell_pos_48	 and  get  another  phone  so  he  can  have  this  one 
6_cell_pos_49	 because  it  is  so  cool  . 
6_cell_pos_50	 The  UI  is  well  designed  and  easy  to  navigate  except  for  the  ridiculous  menu  . 
6_cell_pos_51	 What  were  they  smoking 
6_cell_pos_52	" ""when  they  decided  to  use  a  pig  for  """"  my  account  ,  """"  a  dragon  for  """"  messaging  ,  """""" "
6_cell_pos_53	 etc  . 
6_cell_pos_54	 Other  than  that  ,  the  features  are  all 
6_cell_pos_55	 where  you  would  expect  them  to  be  and  navigating  the  menus  is  quite  intuitive  . 
6_cell_pos_56	 Ca  n't  really  comment  on  reliability  on  this  phone 
6_cell_pos_57	 after  just  two  weeks  , 
6_cell_pos_58	 but  it  has  already  been  dropped  twice 
6_cell_pos_59	 and  still  works  fine  . 
6_cell_pos_60	 The  Bad 
6_cell_pos_61	 Perhaps  because  they  are  affordable  in  other  ways  ,  Virgin  screws 
6_cell_pos_62	 you  on  ringtones  and  background  . 
6_cell_pos_63	 The  four  ringtones  included  are  unacceptable  , 
6_cell_pos_64	 and  you  are  blocked  from  up  or  down 
6_cell_pos_65	 loading  your  own  . 
6_cell_pos_66	 They  do  have  a  pretty  big  collection  on  their  website 
6_cell_pos_67	 you  can  get  for  $  2.50  a  pop  , 
6_cell_pos_68	 but  none  of  them  sound  like  a  phone  . 
6_cell_pos_69	 The  included 
6_cell_pos_70	 wallpapers  were  chosen  to  be  the  most  despicable  choices  possible  too  ,  so  you  are  likely  to  fork  out  $  2.00  for  a  wallpaper  from  their  web  site  for  that  as  well  . 
6_cell_pos_71	 The  buttons  are  a  little  too  small  . 
6_cell_pos_72	 Most  of  the  time  I  do  fine  , 
6_cell_pos_73	 but  every  once  in  a  while  I  hit  two  keys  or  the  wrong  key 
6_cell_pos_74	 because  they  are  so  small  . 
6_cell_pos_75	 Of  course 
6_cell_pos_76	 once  the  numbers  were  all 
6_cell_pos_77	 loaded  into  contacts 
6_cell_pos_78	 and  speed  dials  set 
6_cell_pos_79	 I  have  n't  run  into  that  problem  any  more  . 
6_cell_pos_80	 Battery  life  has  not  lived  up  to  what  I  read  , 
6_cell_pos_81	 but  that  might  be  because  of  how  I  use  it  . 
6_cell_pos_82	 If  I  charge  it  every  night 
6_cell_pos_83	 I  am  fine  . 
6_cell_pos_84	 I  ordered  an  extra  charger 
6_cell_pos_85	 to  keep  in  the  office  and  one  for  the  car  as  well  just  in  case  . 
6_cell_pos_86	Summary
6_cell_pos_87	 After  two  weeks  I  am  happy  with  this  phone 
6_cell_pos_88	 and  would  recommend  it  to  someone 
6_cell_pos_89	 looking  for  a  phone  to  use  for  making  phone  calls  . 
6_cell_pos_90	 It  is  not  big  on  extras  like  a  camera  , 
6_cell_pos_91	 but  what  it  does  it  does  well  . 
6_cell_pos_92	 Virgin  uses  Sprint  's  network  , 
6_cell_pos_93	 see  if  you  can  find  out  about  their  network  in  your  area 
6_cell_pos_94	 before  you  buy  a  Virgin  phone  . 
6_cell_pos_95	 .  .  . 
2_gourmet_neg_1	 Personally  ,  I  did  n't  like  Tazo  's  Red  Bush  Tea  very  much  . 
2_gourmet_neg_2	 I  `  ve  had  three  different  kinds  of  roiboos  teas  so  far  and  this  was  my  least  favorite  . 
2_gourmet_neg_3	 It  seems  like  the  flavor  of  roiboos 
2_gourmet_neg_4	 itself  is  pretty  mild  , 
2_gourmet_neg_5	 and  in  the  case  of  Tazo  's  tea  ,  the  flavors 
2_gourmet_neg_6	 they  add  completely  overwhelm  it  . 
2_gourmet_neg_7	 I  found  that  I  had  to  remove  the  tea  bag  very 
2_gourmet_neg_8	 quickly  lest  the  cup  become  overwhelmingly  lemony  and  acidic  . 
2_gourmet_neg_9	 Perhaps  other  pallettes  will  appreciate  the  strength  of  those  flavors  . 
2_gourmet_neg_10	 Personally  , 
2_gourmet_neg_11	 I  could  n't  wait  to  finish  off  the  box  so  that  I  could  find  a  better  flavor  . 
2_gourmet_neg_12	 The  other  roiboos  teas  I  have  tried  have  had  a  milder  mix  of  flavors  ,  to  a  much  better  overall  effect  . 
2_gourmet_neg_13	 My  personal  choice  right  now  is  Trader  Joe  's  Orange  Spice  Roiboos  , 
2_gourmet_neg_14	 which  apparently  can  be  bought  in  some  , 
2_gourmet_neg_15	 but  not  all  of  their  stores  . 
2_gourmet_neg_16	 The  orange  flavor  is  much  less  up 
2_gourmet_neg_17	 front  than  the  lemon  &  citrus  flavors  in  the  tazo  tea  ,  and  the  overall  effect  of  the  other  spices  is  very  nice  . 
2_gourmet_neg_18	 The  tea  smells  a  lot  like  other  spiced  foods 
2_gourmet_neg_19	 -LRB-  pumpkin  pie  comes  to  mind  -RRB- 
2_gourmet_neg_20	 and  is  very  nice  on  a  gloomy  afternoon  . 
2_gourmet_neg_21	 Also  unlike  the  Tazo  version  ,  the  flavor  of  this  tea  gets  nicer  and  richer  the  longer  you  let  the  tea  bag  steep  , 
2_gourmet_neg_22	 although  even  just  pouring  the  water  over  the  bag 
2_gourmet_neg_23	 and  leaving  it  for  a  few  seconds  is  usually  enough  for  a  nice  cup  . 
2_gourmet_neg_24	 Admittedly  , 
2_gourmet_neg_25	 there  are  a  lot  of  other  roiboos  teas  I  have  not  tried  , 
2_gourmet_neg_26	 but  this  one  has  been  a  hit  with  me 
2_gourmet_neg_27	 because  of  its  good  flavor  and  local  availability  . 
2_gourmet_neg_28	 Keep  in  mind  this  is  not  the  opinion  of  a  tea  expert  , 
2_gourmet_neg_29	 and  I  have  never  had  roiboos  tea  in  Africa  so  I  do  n't  know  what  it  is  supposed  to  taste  like  in  its  authentic  presentation  . 
2_gourmet_neg_30	 Just  my  personal  taste 
6_gourmet_neg_1	 Do  n't  get 
6_gourmet_neg_2	 me  wrong  -- 
6_gourmet_neg_3	 I  'm  not  some  nut  job 
6_gourmet_neg_4	 who  thinks  this  stuff  will  give  you  cancer  due  to  lack  of  testing  . 
6_gourmet_neg_5	 I  'm  just  really  miffed  at  the  fact 
6_gourmet_neg_6	 that  Splenda  has  plenty  of  carbohydrates  in  it  --  24  grams  per  cup  !  ! 
6_gourmet_neg_7	 They  get  away  with  this  by  setting  their  serving  size  to  1  tsp  , 
6_gourmet_neg_8	 which  is  0.5  g  . 
6_gourmet_neg_9	 Would  you  believe  that  in  0.5  g  of  product 
6_gourmet_neg_10	 there  is  less  than  one  gram  of  carbohydrate  !  ? 
6_gourmet_neg_11	 No  way  !  ! 
6_gourmet_neg_12	 The  sweetener  sucralose  is  not  a  carbohydrate  , 
6_gourmet_neg_13	 but  since  it  's  600x  as  sweet  as  sugar  , 
6_gourmet_neg_14	 they  need 
6_gourmet_neg_15	 to  bulk  it  up  to  make 
6_gourmet_neg_16	 it  measure  like  sugar  . 
6_gourmet_neg_17	 But  all  the  maltodextrin  they  use  for  filler  is  carbohydrates  . 
6_gourmet_neg_18	 This  could  really  screw  up  somebody  on  Atkins  '  Induction  phase  . 
6_gourmet_neg_19	 For  example  , 
6_gourmet_neg_20	 the  day  before  I  learned  this  , 
6_gourmet_neg_21	 I  made  some  Kool-Aid  with  Splenda  . 
6_gourmet_neg_22	 I  did  n't  know 
6_gourmet_neg_23	 that  in  2  quarts 
6_gourmet_neg_24	 I  was  drinking  down  24  carbs  ! 
6_gourmet_neg_25	 What  to  do  ? 
6_gourmet_neg_26	 Find  somebody  online 
6_gourmet_neg_27	 who  sells  liquid  sucralose  . 
6_gourmet_neg_28	 They  use  water  as  the  filler  , 
6_gourmet_neg_29	 it  's  super-concentrated  still  , 
6_gourmet_neg_30	 and  it  truly  has  0  carbs  . 
6_gourmet_neg_31	 I  look  forward  to  the  day 
6_gourmet_neg_32	 when  McNeil  Nutritionals  meets  the  demand  for  ZERO-carb  Splenda  . 
6_gourmet_neg_33	 -LRB-  That  's  0.0  g  ,  not  0.49  g  ! 
10_gourmet_pos_1	 I  bought  a  few  bags  of  these  noodles 
10_gourmet_pos_2	 after  reading  a  very  favorable  review  of  them  on  the  Hungry  Girl  website  , 
10_gourmet_pos_3	 and  I  am  glad 
10_gourmet_pos_4	 that  I  did  . 
10_gourmet_pos_5	 They  work  well  in  a  number  of  different  recipes  ,  are  filling  , 
10_gourmet_pos_6	" ""and  add  a  """"  calcium  boost  """"  to  the  dishes"" "
10_gourmet_pos_7	 I  use  them  in  ,  for  very  few  calories  . 
10_gourmet_pos_8	" ""These  are  not  """"  pasta  """"  type  noodles  ,  of  course  -"" "
10_gourmet_pos_9	 the  texture  is  different 
10_gourmet_pos_10	" ""-LRB-  softer  and  kind  of  """"  slippery  """"  -RRB-  ,"" "
10_gourmet_pos_11	 and  they  have  virtually  no  flavor  of  their  own  - 
10_gourmet_pos_12	 they  take  on  the  flavor 
10_gourmet_pos_13	 of  whatever  sauce  or  dressing  you 
10_gourmet_pos_14	 use  with  them  . 
10_gourmet_pos_15	 I  probably  wo  n't  use  these  noodles  with  European-style  or  American-style  sauces  such  as  marinara  or  cheese  sauce  -  those  types  of  sauces  were  created  for  grain-based  pastas  , 
10_gourmet_pos_16	 which  these  are  not  . 
10_gourmet_pos_17	 On  the  other  hand  ,  these  noodles  are  fine  in  such  Asian  recipes  as  Pad  Thai  ,  Lo  Mein  and  Dan-Dan  Noodes 
10_gourmet_pos_18	 -LRB-  basically  ,  noodles  in  a  spicy  peanut  or  sesame  sauce  -RRB-  . 
10_gourmet_pos_19	 There  are  a  lot  of  Asian-style  recipes  in  cookbooks  and  on  the  Internet 
10_gourmet_pos_20	 which  are  fairly  easy  to  make  ,  taste  terrific  , 
10_gourmet_pos_21	 and  work  beautifully  with  these  noodles  . 
10_gourmet_pos_22	 You  can  prepare  yourself  a  real  treat  , 
10_gourmet_pos_23	 if  you  use  these  noodles  in  the  types  of  recipes 
10_gourmet_pos_24	 that  work  well  with  their  texture  , 
10_gourmet_pos_25	 and  for  a  fraction  of  the  calories 
10_gourmet_pos_26	 you  'd  eat  if  using  regular  noodles  or  rice  . 
10_gourmet_pos_27	 In  short  , 
10_gourmet_pos_28	 if  you  attempt  something  like  spaghetti  with  meatballs  or  chicken  cacciatore 
10_gourmet_pos_29	 using  these  noodles  , 
10_gourmet_pos_30	 you  `  re  likely  to  be  disappointed  , 
10_gourmet_pos_31	 but  if  you  use  them  in  Pad  Thai  ,  any  type  of  curry  ,  other  Asian  dishes  ,  or  most  soups  , 
10_gourmet_pos_32	 you  `  re  likely  to  find  yourself  enjoying  a  delicious  and  wonderfully  low-cal  ,  low-carb  meal  . 
10_gourmet_pos_33	 One  thing 
10_gourmet_pos_34	-
10_gourmet_pos_35	 when  you  open  the  bag  , 
10_gourmet_pos_36	 there  is  a  slight  ammonia-like  odor 
10_gourmet_pos_37	 -LRB-  it  smells  ammonia-like  to  me  ,  anyway  -RRB-  . 
10_gourmet_pos_38	 If  you  rinse  the  noodles  well 
10_gourmet_pos_39	 and  then  parboil  them  for  a  few  minutes  ,  as  per  the  package  directions  , 
10_gourmet_pos_40	 the  odor  really  does  disappear  . 
10_gourmet_pos_41	 It  is  not  a  strong  odor  , 
10_gourmet_pos_42	 it  wo  n't  permeate  your  kitchen  or  anything  like  that  , 
10_gourmet_pos_43	 but  you  will  definitely  want  to  rinse  and  parboil  the  noodles  before  using  them  . 
10_gourmet_pos_44	 Just  follow  the  package  directions 
9_gourmet_pos_1	 My  kid  was  upset 
9_gourmet_pos_2	 when  I  got  him  an  improvised  Harry  Potter  broom  for  Christmas  --  O.  K  .  , 
9_gourmet_pos_3	 it  was  n't  an  officially  licensed  product  , 
9_gourmet_pos_4	 but  since  magic  brooms  are  imaginary  anyway  ,  any  stick  with  a  bunch  of  straw  at  one  end  is  as  good  as  any  other  . 
9_gourmet_pos_5	 But  no  --  apparently  a  Corn  Lobby  Broom  was  n't  good  enough  for  him  . 
9_gourmet_pos_6	 Anyway  ,  he  would  n't  talk  to  me  for  a  month  , 
9_gourmet_pos_7	 which  was  good  at  first  , 
9_gourmet_pos_8	 but  then  got  really  annoying  . 
9_gourmet_pos_9	 For  my  kid  's  birthday 
9_gourmet_pos_10	 I  decided  to  get 
9_gourmet_pos_11	 him  something  really  special  , 
9_gourmet_pos_12	 so  I  got  him  this  bag  of  xanthan  gum  . 
9_gourmet_pos_13	 I  even  wrapped  it  up  real  nice  with  wrapping  paper  and  ribbon  . 
9_gourmet_pos_14	 My  kid  opened  his  present 
9_gourmet_pos_15	 and  could  n't  figure  out  what  it  was  . 
9_gourmet_pos_16	" ""It  's  xanthan  gum  ,  """""" "

9_gourmet_pos_23	 he  slowly  replied  ,

9_gourmet_pos_41	 He  hesitated  , 
9_gourmet_pos_42	 and  then  stuck  his  tongue  into  the  powder  . 
9_gourmet_pos_43	 I  was  starting  to  get  impatient  , 
9_gourmet_pos_44	 so  I  grabbed  the  spoon  from  him  ,

9_gourmet_pos_46	" ""you  big  chicken  ,  """""" "
9_gourmet_pos_47	 and  then  I  swallowed  the  powder  . 
9_gourmet_pos_48	 The  stuff 
9_gourmet_pos_49	 dissolved  into  a  thick  ,  slimy  paste  in  my  mouth  , 
9_gourmet_pos_50	 but  I  smiled 
9_gourmet_pos_51	" ""as  I  chewed  it  ,  """"  Mmmmm  .  .  ."" "

9_gourmet_pos_68	 I  said  .

9_gourmet_pos_72	 Stupid  kid 
14_kitchen_neg_1	 If  I  could  give  this  product  0  stars  , 
14_kitchen_neg_2	 I  would  . 
14_kitchen_neg_3	 READ  THE  NEGATIVE  REVIEWS  ,  FOLKS  , 
14_kitchen_neg_4	 AND  BE  FOREWARNED  . 
14_kitchen_neg_5	 I  believed  the  positive  reviews 
14_kitchen_neg_6	 and  ignored  the  negative  ones  ,  much  to  my  exasperation  . 
14_kitchen_neg_7	 When  I  plugged  my  handsome  new  oven  in  ,  the  little  red  digital  display  numbers  came  on  right  away  .  .  . 
14_kitchen_neg_8	 hmmm  .  .  . 
14_kitchen_neg_9	 so  far  so  good  . 
14_kitchen_neg_10	 But  , 
14_kitchen_neg_11	 according  to  the  instructions  , 
14_kitchen_neg_12	 you  are  supposed  to  run  the  oven  with  the  door  open  for  15  minutes  to  get  rid  of  the  new  oven  smell  . 
14_kitchen_neg_13	 Sooo  .  .  . 
14_kitchen_neg_14	 the  owner  's  manual  says 
14_kitchen_neg_15	" ""to  push  the  """"  bake  """"  button  on  the  dashboard  ,"" "

14_kitchen_neg_26	 Still  nothing  . 
14_kitchen_neg_27	 I  unplugged 
14_kitchen_neg_28	 it  and  and  plugged  it  in  again  , 
14_kitchen_neg_29	thinking

14_kitchen_neg_41	 Nada  .

14_kitchen_neg_44	 Still  nothing  . 
14_kitchen_neg_45	 It  just  sat  there 
14_kitchen_neg_46	 and  grinned  at  me  . 
14_kitchen_neg_47	 About  this  time  , 
14_kitchen_neg_48	 I  figured  out 
14_kitchen_neg_49	" ""that  my  unit  was  also  """"  dead  on  arrival  """"  ."" "
14_kitchen_neg_50	 At  least  you  can  get  a  parcel 
14_kitchen_neg_51	 paid  bill 
14_kitchen_neg_52	 of  lading 
14_kitchen_neg_53	 printed  off  from  the  Amazon  website  for  a  defective  product  return  , 
14_kitchen_neg_54	 saving  yourself  the  annoyance  of  prepaying  to  return  a  dead  product 
14_kitchen_neg_55	 you  have  already  paid  for  and  now  must  wait  weeks 
14_kitchen_neg_56	 to  get  a  refund  on  . 
14_kitchen_neg_57	 Amazon  should  take  the  remainder  of  their  stock  of  this  awful  product  out  to  the  back  lot  of  their  warehouse 
14_kitchen_neg_58	 and  run  them  over  with  a  forklift 
4_kitchen_neg_1	 I  returned  the  Honeywell  6011i  humidifier 
4_kitchen_neg_2	 because  the  product  had  2  defects 
4_kitchen_neg_3	 and  the  product  was  very  poorly  designed  . 
4_kitchen_neg_4	 The  6011i  humidifier  had  2  defects  right  out  of  the  box  . 
4_kitchen_neg_5	 The  first  was  that  the  6011i  humidifier  would  not  run  on  the  High  speed  setting 
4_kitchen_neg_6	 but  did  run  on  the  low  and  medium  speed  settings  . 
4_kitchen_neg_7	 The  second  defect  was  that  the  cap  for  one  water  container  had  no  rubber 
4_kitchen_neg_8	 o-ring  seal  and  the  water  bottle  leaked 
4_kitchen_neg_9	 when  upright  in  its  normal  operating  position  . 
4_kitchen_neg_10	 The  fact  that  this  6011i  humidifier  had  2  defects 
4_kitchen_neg_11	says
4_kitchen_neg_12	 that  the  quality  control  for  this  product  must  be  very  low  and  implies  this  product  suffers  from  an  above  average  failure  rate  . 
4_kitchen_neg_13	 The  6011i  humidifier  has  major  design  defects 
4_kitchen_neg_14	 that  make 
4_kitchen_neg_15	 it  difficult  to  operate  and  maintain  the  6011i  humidifier  . 
4_kitchen_neg_16	 The  design  defects  are  so 
4_kitchen_neg_17	major
4_kitchen_neg_18	 that  the  person 
4_kitchen_neg_19	 -LRB-  s  -RRB- 
4_kitchen_neg_20	that
4_kitchen_neg_21	 designed  and  approved  the  design  of  the 
4_kitchen_neg_22	 6011i  humidifier  should  be  shot  or  at  least 
4_kitchen_neg_23	 fired  ! 
4_kitchen_neg_24	 The  first  major  design  defect  is  that  the  water  bottles  will  not  stand  up  by  themselves 
4_kitchen_neg_25	 in  my  sink  . 
4_kitchen_neg_26	 Because  of  this  I  must  hold  the  water  containers  vertically  with  my  hand 
4_kitchen_neg_27	 and  still  can  not  completely  fill  the  water  container  to  the  top  . 
4_kitchen_neg_28	 The  screw-on  caps  for  the  water  containers  are  so  large 
4_kitchen_neg_29	 they  are  difficult  for  my  wife  with  small  hands  to  screw  on 
4_kitchen_neg_30	 while  holding  the  water  container  vertically  upright  . 
4_kitchen_neg_31	 The  next  design  defect  is  that  one  can  not  at  a  glance  check  the  water  level  in  the  water  containers 
4_kitchen_neg_32	 but  must  pick  up  the  water  containers 
4_kitchen_neg_33	 and  turn  them  over  to  check  the  water  level  in  the  container  . 
4_kitchen_neg_34	 One  can  see  if  the  water  container  is  empty  or  nearly  empty  at  a  glance  , 
4_kitchen_neg_35	 but  this  is  of  no  use  if  one  wants  to  quickly  see  if  there  is  enough  water  in  the  water  containers  to  last  until  one  returns  home  from  work  or  will  last  through  the  night  . 
4_kitchen_neg_36	" ""The  last  design  defect  of  the  6011i  humidifier  is  that  the  water  containers  and  humidifier  fan  housing  do  not  just  """"  drop  into  place  """"  on  the  base  ."" "
4_kitchen_neg_37	 One  must  use  one  hand  as  a  guide  for  the  water  container  and  then  still  fiddle  with  the  position\/angle  of  the  water  container  to  get  it  to  seat  properly  . 
4_kitchen_neg_38	 This  is  even  more  difficult  if  both  water  containers  are  removed  for  filling  at  the  same  time  . 
4_kitchen_neg_39	 I  bought  this  6011i  humidifier 
4_kitchen_neg_40	 to  replace  a  Honeywell  humidifier 
4_kitchen_neg_41	 that  finally  failed  after  many  years  of  faithful  service  . 
4_kitchen_neg_42	 I  also  selected  the  6011i  Humidifier 
4_kitchen_neg_43	 because  of  its  many  desirable  features  . 
4_kitchen_neg_44	 However  the  positive  product  features  were  significantly  outweighed  by  the  poor  quality  control  and  the  poor  design  of  the  6011i  Humidifier  . 
4_kitchen_neg_45	 I  believe

10_kitchen_pos_2	 I  decided  to  purchase  this  product 
10_kitchen_pos_3	 this  after  looking  around  for  a  GOOD  desktop  electric  mug  warmer  to  use  with  a  standard  ceramic  mug  .

1_kitchen_pos_1	 Apparently  3rd  in  the  hierarchy  of  4  models  in  the  new  S5  series  of  Miele  vacuum  cleaners  ,  the  features  ,  price  ,  and  accessories  are  not  exactly  linear  in  transition  from  lower  to  higher  models  ,  nor  even  across  series  . 
1_kitchen_pos_2	 Many  of  the  older  series  models  have  more  features  and  a  higher  price  than  the  newer  ones  . 
1_kitchen_pos_3	 They  have  fancy  names  like  Capricorn  ,  Red  Velvet  ,  and  Champagne  , 
1_kitchen_pos_4	 leading  to  much  confusion

1_kitchen_pos_29	 vacuuming  around  and  under  . 
1_kitchen_pos_30	 The  powerbrush  swivels  well  to  get  around  corners  . 
1_kitchen_pos_31	 Brush  duster  -  The  most  commonly  used  attachment 
1_kitchen_pos_32	 -LRB-  for  me  -RRB-  , 
1_kitchen_pos_33	 the  brush  duster  is  also  small 
1_kitchen_pos_34	 -LRB-  slightly  larger  in  diameter  than  the  hose  -RRB-

1_kitchen_pos_38	 This  is  not  mentioned  anywhere  ; 
1_kitchen_pos_39	 you  just  have  to  figure  this  out  for  yourself  . 
1_kitchen_pos_40	 On  low  power  , 
1_kitchen_pos_41	 I  was  able  to  vacuum  places 
1_kitchen_pos_42	 that  never  got  vacuumed  before  ,  like  over  the  spider  web  of  computer  cables  and  telephone  wires  . 
1_kitchen_pos_43	 I  even  vacuumed  the  telephone  itself 
1_kitchen_pos_44	 and  other  dust  collecting  objects  on  my  desk  . 
1_kitchen_pos_45	 Parquet  floor  brush  -  Initially  , 
1_kitchen_pos_46	 I  wondered 
1_kitchen_pos_47	 why  Miele  would  include  this  accessory 
1_kitchen_pos_48	 when  the  powerbrush  was  included  , 
1_kitchen_pos_49	" ""but  this  """"  wider  brush  duster  """""" "

1_kitchen_pos_53	 but  the  paraquet  brush  gathers  and  collects  dust 
1_kitchen_pos_54	 stuck  to  hard  surfaces  better  . 
1_kitchen_pos_55	 On  the  negative  side  , 
1_kitchen_pos_56	 you  might  have  to  vacuum  the  brush 
1_kitchen_pos_57	 itself  to  unstuck  the  dust  , 
1_kitchen_pos_58	 and  I  wondered 
1_kitchen_pos_59	" ""why  they  had  to  inconvenience  the  horse  for  """"  genuine  horse  bristles  """"  ."" "
1_kitchen_pos_60	 There  is  no  permanent  storage  on  the  vacuum  cleaner  for  the  parquet  brush  ,  so  you  have  to  figure  out 
1_kitchen_pos_61	 how  to  ensure  the  parts  do  n't  get  separated  for  life 
1_kitchen_pos_62	 -LRB-  the  powerbrush  takes  precedence  -RRB-  . 
1_kitchen_pos_63	 Cord  rewind  -  The  mechanical  rewind 
1_kitchen_pos_64	 sucked  in  the  entire  length  of  cord  every  single  time  ,  something  like  15  for  15  times  ! 
1_kitchen_pos_65	 -LRB-  The  manual  says 
1_kitchen_pos_66	 to  pull  out  the  entire  length  of  cord  before  use  to  help  dissipate  heat  .  -RRB- 
1_kitchen_pos_67	 Cons  : 
1_kitchen_pos_68	 Price  -  After  all  , 
1_kitchen_pos_69	 it  's  just  a  vacuum  cleaner  .

1_kitchen_pos_79	 What  's  a  Diamond  Dealer  ? 
1_kitchen_pos_80	 Is  this  Amway  ? 
1_kitchen_pos_81	 Release  buttons  -  The  release  buttons  on  the  attachments  and  hose  are  counterintuitive  , 
1_kitchen_pos_82	 being  on  the  part

1_kitchen_pos_88	 you  are  pulling  away  with  . 
1_kitchen_pos_89	 The  hose  extension  button  is  particularly  confusing  . 
1_kitchen_pos_90	 It  's  an  oval  shaped  rocker  button 
1_kitchen_pos_91	" ""that  """"  rocks  """"  very  little  ."" "
1_kitchen_pos_92	 To  extend  the  stainless  steel  hose  , 
1_kitchen_pos_93	 you  have  to  remember 
1_kitchen_pos_94	 which  side  of  the  button 
1_kitchen_pos_95	 -LRB-  top  or  bottom  -RRB- 
1_kitchen_pos_96	 to  press  . 
1_kitchen_pos_97	 There  is  no  distinction  on  which  side  to  press  , 
1_kitchen_pos_98	 and  it  's  always  a  matter 
1_kitchen_pos_99	 of  trial  and  error  as  I  yank  and  tug  at  the  hose 
1_kitchen_pos_100	 while  pressing  top  and  bottom  of  the  extension  button  . 
1_kitchen_pos_101	 Stiff  no  swivel  hose  - 
1_kitchen_pos_102	 The  hose  rotates  at  the  top 
1_kitchen_pos_103	 -LRB-  handle  area  -RRB-  , 
1_kitchen_pos_104	 but  does  not  swivel  at  the  base 
1_kitchen_pos_105	 where  it  connects  to  the  machine  . 
1_kitchen_pos_106	 Instead  of  disconnecting  and  reconnecting  to  get  rid  of  twists  , 
1_kitchen_pos_107	 I  'd  rather  pick  up  the  powerhead 
1_kitchen_pos_108	 and  spin  it  around 
1_kitchen_pos_109	 to  get  out  the  twists  . 
1_kitchen_pos_110	 The  flex  hose  diameter  is  larger  than  I  'm  used  to  , 
1_kitchen_pos_111	 making  the  hose  stiffer  and  difficult  to  store  in  the  same  closet 
1_kitchen_pos_112	 where  I  used  to  store  my  old  vacuum  cleaner  . 
1_kitchen_pos_113	 Considering  the  price  ,  an  electrical  slip  ring  would  have  been  nice  . 
1_kitchen_pos_114	 Bag  full  indicator 
1_kitchen_pos_115	 -  The  mechanical  bag  full  indicator  is  actually  an  indicator  of  how  much  the  vacuum  cleaner  is  straining  to  suck  . 
1_kitchen_pos_116	 Put  your  hand  over  the  end 
1_kitchen_pos_117	 to  block  suction 
1_kitchen_pos_118	 and  it  will  indicate  bag  full  . 
1_kitchen_pos_119	 Right  out  of  the  box  on  short  carpet  , 
1_kitchen_pos_120	 it  indicated  bag  full  on  high  power  . 
1_kitchen_pos_121	 As  I  turned  the  power  down  , 
1_kitchen_pos_122	 it  indicated  less  full  sequentially  . 
1_kitchen_pos_123	 You  have  to  read  the  instructions  about  using  the  floor  tool  with  the  tool  slightly  off  the  floor 
1_kitchen_pos_124	 to  get  an  accurate  reading  from  the  indicator  . 
1_kitchen_pos_125	 Even  at  that  , 
1_kitchen_pos_126	 there  are  caveats  about  fine  dust  or  pet  hair 
1_kitchen_pos_127	 that  can  fool  the  indicator  . 
1_kitchen_pos_128	 Extra  stuff  ? 
1_kitchen_pos_129	 -  The  parquet  brush  comes  attached  with  a  short  plastic  extension 
1_kitchen_pos_130	 that  was  difficult  to  plug  directly  into  the  stainless  steel  hose 
1_kitchen_pos_131	 -LRB-  button  does  n't  easily  click  into  place  -RRB-  . 
1_kitchen_pos_132	 The  extension  is  n't  needed  to  connect  the  parquet  brush  ,  so  you  have  to  remove  it 
1_kitchen_pos_133	 and  keep  track  of  where  you  put  it  . 
1_kitchen_pos_134	 To  this  day  , 
1_kitchen_pos_135	 I  still  have  n't  figured  out  what  the  extension  is  for  ,  other  than  to  connect  other  attachments 
1_kitchen_pos_136	 that  I  might  buy  in  the  future  . 
1_kitchen_pos_137	 This  is  yet  another  piece  with  no  place  to  store  on  the  vacuum  cleaner  that  I  must  ensure  does  not  get 
1_kitchen_pos_138	 separated  for  life

1_kitchen_pos_154	 but  brand-new  right  out  of  the  box 
1_kitchen_pos_155	 the  frame  for  the  normal  filters  came  with  a  broken  cheap  plastic  handle  , 
1_kitchen_pos_156	 apparently  due  to  the  way 
1_kitchen_pos_157	 it  was  shipped  with  the  handle 
1_kitchen_pos_158	 protruding  out  the  cardboard  wrapping  . 
1_kitchen_pos_159	 You  do  n't  even  need  the  handle  for  the  frame 
1_kitchen_pos_160	 to  function  properly  , 
1_kitchen_pos_161	 but  for  the  kind  of  money  I  paid  ,  nothing  should  be  broken  out  of  the  box  . 
1_kitchen_pos_162	 The  vendor  that  I  bought  it  from  -LRB-  Best  Vacuum  -RRB- 
1_kitchen_pos_163	replaced
1_kitchen_pos_164	 it  for  free  . 
1_kitchen_pos_165	 So  is  it  worth 
1_kitchen_pos_166	 $  800  ? 
1_kitchen_pos_167	 It  does  a  good  job  , 
1_kitchen_pos_168	 but  only  time  will  tell  .  .
