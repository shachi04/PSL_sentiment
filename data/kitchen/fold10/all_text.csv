10_kitchen_pos_1	"As I tend to "" nurse "" a cup of tea at the office for a while ,"
10_kitchen_pos_2	I decided to purchase this product
10_kitchen_pos_3	this after looking around for a GOOD desktop electric mug warmer to use with a standard ceramic mug .
10_kitchen_pos_4	Such a product just does n't seem
10_kitchen_pos_5	to exist ;
10_kitchen_pos_6	check the Amazon customer ratings .
10_kitchen_pos_7	I had one a number of years ago , and it was lousy
10_kitchen_pos_8	-LRB- had hoped
10_kitchen_pos_9	that someone had built a better mousetrap ,
10_kitchen_pos_10	but no one has ! -RRB-
10_kitchen_pos_11	I purchased this mug just about a month ago .
10_kitchen_pos_12	It 's so good ,
10_kitchen_pos_13	I had to share the secret ,
10_kitchen_pos_14	and even if an improved electric warmer DID
10_kitchen_pos_15	exist ,
10_kitchen_pos_16	I do n't think
10_kitchen_pos_17	I 'd bother with its cord and risks
10_kitchen_pos_18	given how good this is .
10_kitchen_pos_19	I 'm sorry to see , though ,
10_kitchen_pos_20	that it 's no longer available through Amazon
10_kitchen_pos_21	-LRB- perhaps elsewhere on the Web ? -RRB- .
10_kitchen_pos_22	I can make a mug of tea
10_kitchen_pos_23	-LRB- a generous 20 oz -RRB-
10_kitchen_pos_24	around 10a . m . ,
10_kitchen_pos_25	and even by mid
10_kitchen_pos_26	to late afternoon , 4 or 5p . m . ,
10_kitchen_pos_27	it 's still warm enough
10_kitchen_pos_28	to enjoy .
10_kitchen_pos_29	And that 's after leaving the top off for the first half hour or so to let it cool enough
10_kitchen_pos_30	to drink !
10_kitchen_pos_31	Indeed ,
10_kitchen_pos_32	"if there 's a "" fault """
10_kitchen_pos_33	with it ,
10_kitchen_pos_34	it 's almost TOO efficient if you use boiling water for the tea
10_kitchen_pos_35	and want to take a sip right
10_kitchen_pos_36	after you ` ve finished brewing !
10_kitchen_pos_37	"Though called a "" travel "" mug ,"
10_kitchen_pos_38	it wo n't fit into any auto cupholder
10_kitchen_pos_39	I ` ve seen .
10_kitchen_pos_40	It 's really perfect for a desk .
10_kitchen_pos_41	It 's relatively low
10_kitchen_pos_42	-LRB- taller than a typical ceramic mug , though -RRB- ,
10_kitchen_pos_43	the base is nice and wide ,
10_kitchen_pos_44	and there 's a ring of rubber\/silicone type material
10_kitchen_pos_45	-LRB-
10_kitchen_pos_46	which has not scuffed anything on my desk -RRB-
10_kitchen_pos_47	around the edge of the bottom
10_kitchen_pos_48	that really is non-slip ;
10_kitchen_pos_49	between these features
10_kitchen_pos_50	it seems quite stable .
10_kitchen_pos_51	The removable black plastic top
10_kitchen_pos_52	-LRB- friction
10_kitchen_pos_53	secured with the typical silicone type O ring around the edge -RRB-
10_kitchen_pos_54	allows
10_kitchen_pos_55	you to move the opening anywhere
10_kitchen_pos_56	you want ,
10_kitchen_pos_57	to use left or right handed .
10_kitchen_pos_58	There 's a simple slide
10_kitchen_pos_59	to open\/close the drinking aperature .
10_kitchen_pos_60	The interior is also stainless steel , so no plastic taste .
10_kitchen_pos_61	Even with boiling water inside , the outside remains virtually at room temperature
10_kitchen_pos_62	-LRB- as you 'd expect ,
10_kitchen_pos_63	given its thermal efficiency -RRB- .
10_kitchen_pos_64	My only complaint
10_kitchen_pos_65	-LRB- minor -RRB-
10_kitchen_pos_66	is that it is NOT dishwasher safe
10_kitchen_pos_67	-LRB- and I have n't tested it ! -RRB- ,
10_kitchen_pos_68	but it 's easy to hand wash .
10_kitchen_pos_69	With the wide mouth ,
10_kitchen_pos_70	you can readily get your hand into it to clean the bottom .
10_kitchen_pos_71	"I have several inexpensive auto "" insulated "" mugs"
10_kitchen_pos_72	-LRB- key word here ,
10_kitchen_pos_73	"I think , is "" inexpensive "" -RRB- ,"
10_kitchen_pos_74	that are truly underwhelming ,
10_kitchen_pos_75	so initially I did n't have high expectations for this ,
10_kitchen_pos_76	but it really is fantastic .
10_kitchen_pos_77	If you want a hot beverage
10_kitchen_pos_78	to keep for several hours on your desk ,
10_kitchen_pos_79	this is for you !
10_kitchen_pos_80	No regrets
