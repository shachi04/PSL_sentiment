17_gourmet_neg_1	This carafe was initially perfect .
17_gourmet_neg_2	The design is attractive and simple ,
17_gourmet_neg_3	and it fits well in my bag in the mornings .
17_gourmet_neg_4	The problem then began that
17_gourmet_neg_5	keeping liquids boiling hot would cause it to explode after being jostled in on my morning commute .
17_gourmet_neg_6	I attempted to remedy this by cooling my morning coffee or tea in the morning ,
17_gourmet_neg_7	although I felt
17_gourmet_neg_8	this was partially defeating the purpose of bringing in my own coffee or tea .
17_gourmet_neg_9	Then it became an issue
17_gourmet_neg_10	that the liquid would either leak or shoot out of the carafe
17_gourmet_neg_11	after being turned the slightest direction other than straight up .
17_gourmet_neg_12	I 'd suggest
17_gourmet_neg_13	saving yourself the trouble and tea stained clothes by buying a different carafe altogether
