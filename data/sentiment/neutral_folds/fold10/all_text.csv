12_cell_neg_1	 I  ordered  a  Motorola  RAZR  V3  Mauve  Phone  -LRB-  Unlocked  -RRB- 
12_cell_neg_2	 a  month  ago  . 
12_cell_neg_3	 I  was  hoping 
12_cell_neg_4	 to  get  the  color 
12_cell_neg_5	 that  I  saw  on  the  web  page  .  .  .  and 
12_cell_neg_6	 that  's 
12_cell_neg_7	 where  the  problem  lies  . 
12_cell_neg_8	 The  image  shown  is  completely  misleading  . 
12_cell_neg_9	 The  phone  that  I  received  ,  was  mauve 
12_cell_neg_10	 but  a  different  one  from  the  picture 
12_cell_neg_11	 shown  on  the  Amazon  web  site  . 
12_cell_neg_12	 The  mauve  phone  that  I  got  was  a  grayish  dull  mauve  and  not  the  pretty  pinkish  mauve  as  advertised  . 
12_cell_neg_13	 Also  ,  the  phone  had  2  different  color  tones  . 
12_cell_neg_14	 At  night\/in  the  lighting  at  night  ,  the  top  part  of  the  phone  -LRB-  the  part  that  flips  open  -RRB- 
12_cell_neg_15	 and  its  corresponding  part  at  the  back  of  the  phone  looks  completely  gray  . 
12_cell_neg_16	 Needless  to  say  , 
12_cell_neg_17	 I  spoke  to  customer  service 
12_cell_neg_18	 and  sent  the  phone  back  for  an  exchange  . 
12_cell_neg_19	 I  did  n't  have  to  pay  the  shipping  charges  . 
12_cell_neg_20	 The  2nd  phone 
12_cell_neg_21	 that  came  had  the  same  color  problem  again  ,  so  for  the  2nd  time  I  returned  it 
12_cell_neg_22	 and  got  my  money  refunded  . 
12_cell_neg_23	 I  gave  1  star  due  to  the  customer  service 
12_cell_neg_24	 provided  , 
12_cell_neg_25	 but  again  they  could  not  help  me  . 
12_cell_neg_26	 Some  one  said 
12_cell_neg_27	 it  could  be  an  item  with  a  defect  .  .  .  but  for  me 
12_cell_neg_28	 the  whole  experience  was  disappointing  . 
12_cell_neg_29	 If  you  are  ready  to  spend  so  much  on  this  phone  its  because  of  the  brand  ,  and  the  '  color  ' 
12_cell_neg_30	 which  you  will  never  get 
12_cell_neg_31	 because  Amazon  has  put  the  wrong  image  on  the  web  page  .  .  .  very  misleading  and  wrong  to  all  the  customers  . 
12_cell_neg_32	 Incidentally  ,  this  color  as  seen  is  offered  by  Verizon 
12_cell_neg_33	 and  they  call 
12_cell_neg_34	 it  '  pink  '  , 
12_cell_neg_35	 but  Amazon  calls  it  '  mauve  '  , 
12_cell_neg_36	 though  the  phone  and  the  image 
12_cell_neg_37	 shown  do  not  match  . 
12_cell_neg_38	 So  stay  away  from  ordering  this  pretty  mauve  phone  .  .  .  all 
12_cell_neg_39	 you  will  get  is  loads  of  disappointment  with  your  time  being  wasted  . 
1_cell_neg_1	 In  summary  ,  Microsoft  's  software  and  T-Mobile  's  service  have  ruined  a  brilliant  design  -LRB-  although  with  a  couple  of  flaws  -RRB- 
1_cell_neg_2	 from  HTC  . 
1_cell_neg_3	 There  are  many  pros  and  cons  about  this  device  and  the  service  that  it  is  shackled  to  . 
1_cell_neg_4	 I  will  break  it  down  to  Hardware  ,  Software  and  Cell  Phone  Service  Provider  . 
1_cell_neg_5	 Hardware  Pro  's  : 
1_cell_neg_6	 A  lot  has  been  written  about  this  aspect  of  the  device  ,  so  I  `  ll  keep  this  to  a  minimum  -  The  best  form  factor 
1_cell_neg_7	 I  `  ve  ever  seen  . 
1_cell_neg_8	 This  device  provides  you  the  power  of  a  Blackberry  without  the  bulky  hardware 
1_cell_neg_9	 so  I  can  put  it  in  my  pocket  comfortably 
1_cell_neg_10	 and  not  have  to  look  like  a  geek  with  the  belt  holster  . 
1_cell_neg_11	 -  A  key  selling  point  for  me  was  the  combined  Bluetooth  ,  Wi-Fi  and  quad-band  connectivity 
1_cell_neg_12	 that  enabled  me  to  connect  a  wireless  headset  ,  cruise  web  pages 
1_cell_neg_13	 and  have  access 
1_cell_neg_14	 to  email 
1_cell_neg_15	 when  in  the  US  or  Europe  . 
1_cell_neg_16	 -  The  phone  quality  is  excellent  . 
1_cell_neg_17	 -  The  keyboard  layout  is  excellent  and  easy  to  use  for  medium  sized  emails  . 
1_cell_neg_18	 -  The  battery  life  is  great 
1_cell_neg_19	 when  Wi-Fi  is  not  enabled  and  adequate 
1_cell_neg_20	 when  it  is  . 
1_cell_neg_21	 -LRB-  I  `  ve  rarely  struggled  with  a  dying  battery  .  -RRB-  Stand-by 
1_cell_neg_22	 power  management  appears  to  be  excellent  . 
1_cell_neg_23	 -  Charging  of  the  device  is  very  quick  . 
1_cell_neg_24	 -  The  display  , 
1_cell_neg_25	 while  a  little  small  , 
1_cell_neg_26	 is  crystal  clear  and  surprisingly  easy  to  use  given  its  size  . 
1_cell_neg_27	 -  The  camera  is  pretty  good  and  it  's  been  really  great 
1_cell_neg_28	 emailing  photo  's  to  people  as  I  'm  traveling  around  . 
1_cell_neg_29	 After  all  of  the  cons 
1_cell_neg_30	 that  you  `  ll  read  below  you 
1_cell_neg_31	 `  ll  wonder 
1_cell_neg_32	 why  I  ever  bought  the  device 
1_cell_neg_33	 and  why  I  still  use  it  . 
1_cell_neg_34	 Well  here  it  is  : 
1_cell_neg_35	 1  .  T-Mobile  locked  me  into  a  2  year  contract  on  a  very  expensive  device  . 
1_cell_neg_36	 2  .  It  has  great  hardware 
1_cell_neg_37	 that  I  can  use  in  the  US  and  Europe  , 
1_cell_neg_38	 I  'm  just  hoping 
1_cell_neg_39	 that  Microsoft  will  finally  get 
1_cell_neg_40	 it  right  . 
1_cell_neg_41	 Hardware  Con  's 
1_cell_neg_42	 -  The  touch  sensitive  volume  button  is  the  most  ill-conceived  feature 
1_cell_neg_43	 I  `  ve  ever  seen  . 
1_cell_neg_44	 Even  after  playing  around  with  various  settings 
1_cell_neg_45	 it  is  still  hard  to  quickly  set  the  volume  at  the  desired  level  . 
1_cell_neg_46	 Even  worse  , 
1_cell_neg_47	 when  using  the  phone  your  ear  or  finger  can  inadvertently  hit  the  control 
1_cell_neg_48	 and  randomly  change  the  volume  . 
1_cell_neg_49	 -  The  TI  OMAP  850  at  201MHz  is  not  beefy  enough  for  the  software 
1_cell_neg_50	 that  is  loaded  onto  the  device  . 
1_cell_neg_51	 However  , 
1_cell_neg_52	 the  blame  could  well  be  laid  at  Microsoft  's  door  for  writing  inefficient  code 
1_cell_neg_53	 and  having  poor  scheduling  software  between  tasks  and  applications  . 
1_cell_neg_54	 Either  way  ,  performance  is  very  slow  for  some  basic  functions 
1_cell_neg_55	 -LRB-  see  below  -RRB- 
1_cell_neg_56	and
1_cell_neg_57	 I  'm  afraid 
1_cell_neg_58	 some  of  the  blame  needs  to  be  laid  at  the  choice  of  processor  . 
1_cell_neg_59	 Software  Pro  's 
1_cell_neg_60	 -  Not  many 
1_cell_neg_61	 that  really  come  to  mind  . 
1_cell_neg_62	 Software  Con  's 
1_cell_neg_63	 -LRB-  I  hope 
1_cell_neg_64	 you  `  re  sitting  comfortably  -RRB- 
1_cell_neg_65	-
1_cell_neg_66	 When  a  call  is  on  call 
1_cell_neg_67	 waiting  the  phone  fails  to  give  an  option  to  the  user  to  select  which  call  to  take  and 
1_cell_neg_68	 which  call  to  put  on  hold  or  drop\/ignore  . 
1_cell_neg_69	 On  the  occasions 
1_cell_neg_70	 this  problem  has  occurred  with  me  the  call 
1_cell_neg_71	 that  is  dropped\/kept  appears  random  with  a  preference  to  switch  to  the  incoming  call  no  matter 
1_cell_neg_72	 what  is  depressed  . 
1_cell_neg_73	 The  other  call  is  dropped  and  not  put  on  hold  . 
1_cell_neg_74	-
1_cell_neg_75	 When  a  call  is  incoming 
1_cell_neg_76	 and  the  keyboard  is  locked  , 
1_cell_neg_77	 if  the  user  depresses  the  green  phone  key  the  call  is  dropped  . 
1_cell_neg_78	 This  is  extremely  counter  intuitive  . 
1_cell_neg_79	" ""If  the  user  presses  anything  other  than  the  """"  answer  """"  key  the  call  is  dropped  and  sometimes  the  call  has  been  dropped  even"" "
1_cell_neg_80	" ""when  I  have  depressed  the  """"  answer  """"  key  ."" "
1_cell_neg_81	 -  The  contacts  database  is  extremely  rudimentary  with  a  very  limited  number  of  views  and  filters 
1_cell_neg_82	 that  can  be  used  . 
1_cell_neg_83	 Even  worse  ,  upon  selection  ,  the  contacts  database  takes  between  5  and  8  seconds 
1_cell_neg_84	 to  open  . 
1_cell_neg_85	 Now  , 
1_cell_neg_86	 I  have  what  some  would  call  a  large  database  of  contacts  , 
1_cell_neg_87	 but  considering 
1_cell_neg_88	 that  the  Palm  OS  version  responded  immediately  with  a  far  more  sophisticated  use  model  this  excuse  does  not  wash  . 
1_cell_neg_89	 It  's  simply  a  poorly  architected  database  . 
1_cell_neg_90	 -  The  user  interface  for  entering  a  new  contact  is  rudimentary 
1_cell_neg_91	 -LRB-  as  are  all  dialog  windows  on  this  device  .  -RRB- 
1_cell_neg_92	 -  One  of  the  most  annoying  aspects  of  this  device  is  the  alarm  clock  . 
1_cell_neg_93	 The  user  interface  looks  like  it  was  written  in  10  minutes 
1_cell_neg_94	 and  was  clearly  not  verified  for  correctness  . 
1_cell_neg_95	 The  digital  watch  I  had  in  1982  had  the  same  degree  of  sophistication 
1_cell_neg_96	 but  with  a  more  intuitive  use  model 
1_cell_neg_97	 and  was  more  thoroughly  debugged  . 
1_cell_neg_98	 First  of  all  ,  the  user  only  gets  to  select  a  time  and  if  the  alarm  is  on  or  off  . 
1_cell_neg_99	 From  the  interface 
1_cell_neg_100	 you  would  assume  you  could  only  set  a  single  alarm  .  .  . 
1_cell_neg_101	 if  only  it  were  that  obvious  . 
1_cell_neg_102	 The  best  way  to  explain  this  buggy  piece  of  software  is  with  an  example  : 
1_cell_neg_103	 I  set  the  alarm  for  6am  ; 
1_cell_neg_104	 the  next  day  the  alarm  goes  off  at  6am  . 
1_cell_neg_105	 That  day  I  set  the  alarm  for  7am  - 
1_cell_neg_106	 the  following  day  the  alarm  goes  off  at  6am  and  7am  . 
1_cell_neg_107	 The  next  day  I  set  the  alarm  for  7:30  am  and  you  guessed  it  , 
1_cell_neg_108	 the  alarm  now  goes  off  three  times  . 
1_cell_neg_109	 The  best  that  I  `  ve  been  able  to  deduce 
1_cell_neg_110	 -LRB-  of  course  ,  this  type  of  behavior 
1_cell_neg_111	 is  not  documented  in  the  user  manual 
1_cell_neg_112	 that  comes  with  the  device  -RRB- 
1_cell_neg_113	" ""is  that  the  user  has  to  actively  select  """"  off  """"  for  the  current  setting"" "
1_cell_neg_114	" ""before  setting  """"  on  """"  for  the  new  time  ."" "
1_cell_neg_115	 But  there  is  no  indication  of  what  alarms  are  set  ,  so  after  a  while  or  a  particularly  busy  week  you  can  loose  track  of  what  's  set  and  what  is  n't  .  .  .  the  only  way  to  clear  all  of  the  alarms 
1_cell_neg_116	 that  have  been  set  is  a  hard  re-boot  . 
1_cell_neg_117	 -  The  calculator  is  a  joke  . 
1_cell_neg_118	 If  this  took  an  engineer  10  minutes  to  write  they  should  be  fired  . 
1_cell_neg_119	 A  calculator  watch  in  the  '  80  's  had  more  sophisticated  features  . 
1_cell_neg_120	 The  user  interface  is  so  bad 
1_cell_neg_121	 it  's  hard  to  describe  it  in  words  . 
1_cell_neg_122	 -  Microsoft  truly  does  not  understand 
1_cell_neg_123	 how  a  user  would  like  to  use  the  device 
1_cell_neg_124	 and  instead  insists  on  using  the  same  usage  model 
1_cell_neg_125	 that  they  `  ve  inflicted  upon  us  since  Windows  95  . 
1_cell_neg_126	 Most  features  or  function  have  to  be  navigated  through  the  Start  menu  button  . 
1_cell_neg_127	 Applications  are  nested  and  features  are  hidden  behind  several  annoying  menu  selections  . 
1_cell_neg_128	 Some  features  are  simply  hard  to  find  , 
1_cell_neg_129	 but  should  it  really  take  so  many  menu  selections 
1_cell_neg_130	 to  find  common  tools  or  applications  ? 
1_cell_neg_131	 -  The  use  of  alarms  or  reminders  is  ambiguous  - 
1_cell_neg_132	" ""to  put  the  device  in  """"  Silent  """"  mode  ,"" "
1_cell_neg_133	 but  leave  alarms  on 
1_cell_neg_134	 because  you  want  to  sleep  and  only  want  your  alarm  to  wake 
1_cell_neg_135	you
1_cell_neg_136	 up  ,  for  example  , 
1_cell_neg_137	 does  not  work  . 
1_cell_neg_138	 Calendar  reminders  will  be  active 
1_cell_neg_139	 as  they  are  assigned  the  alarm  property  instead  of  their  own  or  the  notification  property  . 
1_cell_neg_140	 The  only  way  around  this  is  to  cancel  reminders  for  all  day  events  .  .  . 
1_cell_neg_141	otherwise
1_cell_neg_142	 you  get  an  alarm  at  midnight  . 
1_cell_neg_143	 -  So  , 
1_cell_neg_144	 on  my  Nokia  phone  a  thousand  years  ago  , 
1_cell_neg_145	 when  I  went  to  Europe  my  phone  would  have  a  simple  selection  for  the  new  frequency 
1_cell_neg_146	 I  needed 
1_cell_neg_147	 once  landed  . 
1_cell_neg_148	 The  phone  would  then  automatically  connect  to  the  provider  available  . 
1_cell_neg_149	 It  was  n't  completely  automatic  , 
1_cell_neg_150	 but  the  user  interaction  was  simple  and  intuitive  . 
1_cell_neg_151	 Not  with  the  Dash  . 
1_cell_neg_152	 First  of  all  T-Mobile  does  n't  help  by  keeping  a  radio  button  on  your  online  account  that  you  have  to  select  to  enable  international  roaming  . 
1_cell_neg_153	 The  feature  is  free 
1_cell_neg_154	 so  why  not  add  a  selection  anyway  ? 
1_cell_neg_155	 All  you  know 
1_cell_neg_156	 when  you  get  to  your  destination  is  that  your  phone  wo  n't  connect  to  the  local  network  no  matter 
1_cell_neg_157	 what  you  do  . 
1_cell_neg_158	 Now  , 
1_cell_neg_159	assuming
1_cell_neg_160	 that  you  worked  this  out  , 
1_cell_neg_161	 you  are  now  faced  with  the  challenge  of  actually  connecting  to  the  local  provider  's  network  . 
1_cell_neg_162	 On  my  Blackberry  this  was  automatic  , 
1_cell_neg_163	 but  of  course  with  Microsoft 
1_cell_neg_164	 there  are  selections  to  make  ,  searches  to  activate  and  various  other  contortions 
1_cell_neg_165	 that  need  to  be  gone  through  before  you  connect  to  the  provider  of  choice  . 
1_cell_neg_166	 Assuming  that  you  get 
1_cell_neg_167	 connected  at  all  . 
1_cell_neg_168	 -  ActiveSync  : 
1_cell_neg_169	 This  is  the  most  annoying  piece  of  software  in  that  it  just  does  not  work  . 
1_cell_neg_170	 Worse  still  , 
1_cell_neg_171	 when  it  does  not  work  it  gives  a  cryptic  error  message 
1_cell_neg_172	 stating  that  an  error  has  occurred  and  some  data  will  be  lost  next  time  you  perform  synchronization  . 
1_cell_neg_173	 It  does  not  provide  you  with  a  fix  ,  a  hint  or  a  path  so  that  you  do  n't  lose  data  . 
1_cell_neg_174	 It  does  not  even  tell  you  the  data 
1_cell_neg_175	 that  was  lost  . 
1_cell_neg_176	 So  , 
1_cell_neg_177	 I  'm  using  a  Microsoft  Mobile  OS  with  Microsoft  XP  and  Microsoft  Outlook 
1_cell_neg_178	 and  they  ca  n't  get  that  right  ? 
1_cell_neg_179	 -LRB-  OK  , 
1_cell_neg_180	 it  maybe  serves  me  right  for  signing  up  to  so  much  Microsoft  , 
1_cell_neg_181	 but  come  on  .  -RRB- 
1_cell_neg_182	 This  was  another  primary  purchasing  driver  for  me  . 
1_cell_neg_183	 I  am  very  busy  and  want  to  have  my  schedule  up  to  date  between  my  PC  and  PDA  -  all  the  time  . 
1_cell_neg_184	 It  's  the  only  way  to  keep  organized  . 
1_cell_neg_185	 I  thought  that  with  the  same  provider  of  all  the  software 
1_cell_neg_186	 I  'd  be  OK  . 
1_cell_neg_187	 Also  , 
1_cell_neg_188	 as  this  feature  has  been  around  for  over  a  decade  from  Palm 
1_cell_neg_189	 and  perfected  by  Blackberry  .  .  . 
1_cell_neg_190	 how  hard  can  it  be  ? 
1_cell_neg_191	 There  are  probably  annoying  nits  that  I  have  with  the  software  , 
1_cell_neg_192	 but  those  are  the  major  ones  . 
1_cell_neg_193	 And  they  are  major  . 
1_cell_neg_194	 Considering  this  is  Windows  Mobile  5.0  what  on  earth  were  they 
1_cell_neg_195	 doing  for  1.0  ,  2.0  , 
1_cell_neg_196	 etc  .  ? 
1_cell_neg_197	 Service  Provider  Pro 
1_cell_neg_198	 -  T-Mobile  is  useful  to  me  for  traveling  in  Europe  . 
1_cell_neg_199	 They  have  much  better  coverage  over  there  than  in  the  US 
1_cell_neg_200	-LRB-
1_cell_neg_201	 where  I  'm  actually  paying  -RRB-  . 
1_cell_neg_202	 -  Their  package  is  competitive  . 
1_cell_neg_203	 Service  Provider  Con  : 
1_cell_neg_204	 -  Coverage  is  not  good  enough  . 
1_cell_neg_205	 I  'm  in  San  Francisco 
1_cell_neg_206	 and  I  have  dead  spots  in  my  house  . 
1_cell_neg_207	 -  Their  back-end  connectivity  with  your  email  providers  is  terribly  buggy  . 
1_cell_neg_208	 At  random  times 
1_cell_neg_209	 you  will  get  cryptic  messages 
1_cell_neg_210	saying
1_cell_neg_211	 that  you  must  have  something  wrong  with  your  connection 
1_cell_neg_212	 and  emails  ca  n't  be  accessed  . 
1_cell_neg_213	 But  you  know 
1_cell_neg_214	 there  's  nothing 
1_cell_neg_215	 wrong  with  your  connection 
1_cell_neg_216	 because  you  `  ve  been  on  the  browser  . 
1_cell_neg_217	 Also  , 
1_cell_neg_218	 there  was  a  whole  day 
1_cell_neg_219	 that  emails  were  not  accessible  . 
1_cell_neg_220	 Because  of  the  many  issues 
1_cell_neg_221	 that  I  'd 
1_cell_neg_222	 had  with  email 
1_cell_neg_223	 set  up 
1_cell_neg_224	 and  maintaining  a  connection 
1_cell_neg_225	 I  went  through  various  debug  routines 
1_cell_neg_226	 wondering  what  had  failed  . 
1_cell_neg_227	 When  I  finally  called  technical  support 
1_cell_neg_228	 they  told  me 
1_cell_neg_229	 that  their  service  was  down  -  no  apology  ,  no  notification  ,  no  nothing  . 
1_cell_neg_230	 Certainly  no  minutes  to  make  up  for  the  inconvenience  . 
1_cell_neg_231	 -LRB-  So  , 
1_cell_neg_232	 why  did  n't  I  call  technical  support  earlier  ? 
1_cell_neg_233	 read  below  .  .  .  -RRB- 
1_cell_neg_234	 -  Their  technical  support  structure  is  terrible  . 
1_cell_neg_235	" ""I  have  collectively  wasted  over  12  hours  of  my  life  on  their  """"  help  """"  line  ."" "
1_cell_neg_236	 I  'm  not  going  to  go  into  details  as  it  would  just  take  too  long  . 
1_cell_neg_237	 Bottom  line  , 
1_cell_neg_238	 if  you  have  a  problem  with  your  phone  say 
1_cell_neg_239	" ""Dash  """"  at  the  prompt"" "
1_cell_neg_240	and
1_cell_neg_241	 then  ask  for  Tier  Three  Data  support  . 
1_cell_neg_242	 Everything  you  get 
1_cell_neg_243	 before  that  is  a  waste  of  your  time  as  the  technicians 
1_cell_neg_244	 you  `  ll  encounter  have  inadequate  training  . 
1_cell_neg_245	 If  you  are  then  put  on  hold  and  are  given  another  number 
1_cell_neg_246	 to  dial  -  DO  NOT  DO  IT  - 
1_cell_neg_247	 This  cycles 
1_cell_neg_248	 you  back  around  to  Tier  Two  Data  Support 
1_cell_neg_249	 and  you  have  to  go  back  to  the  back  of  the  line  for  someone 
1_cell_neg_250	 that  understands  the  device  . 
1_cell_neg_251	 So  ,  should  you  buy 
1_cell_neg_252	 it  ? 
1_cell_neg_253	 Wait  until  Windows  Mobile  6.0  comes  out  at  least  . 
1_cell_neg_254	 Maybe  another  provider  will  pick  up  the  device  by  that  time  . 
1_cell_neg_255	 Then  see  what  else  is  available 
13_cell_pos_1	 I  'm  a  long-running  Virgin  customer  , 
13_cell_pos_2	 but  additionally  I  work  as  a  developer  in  the  mobile  industry  ,  and  so  I  `  ve  had  experience 
13_cell_pos_3	 using  literally  scores  of  handsets  from  every  imaginable  carrier 
13_cell_pos_4	 -LRB-  including  non-US  -RRB-  . 
13_cell_pos_5	 Previous  Virgin  phones  I  `  ve  used  include  the  Vox  8610 
13_cell_pos_6	 and  Kyocera  2255  . 
13_cell_pos_7	 My  8610  still  works  , 
13_cell_pos_8	 but  it  's  a  bit  bulky  and  heavy  for  my  tastes 
13_cell_pos_9	 and  I  decided 
13_cell_pos_10	 to  upgrade  . 
13_cell_pos_11	 Let  's  start  with  the  positives  : 
13_cell_pos_12	 -  Very  compact  design  . 
13_cell_pos_13	 This  is  probably  the  cheapest  phone  of  its  size\/capabilities  available  anywhere  . 
13_cell_pos_14	 It  is  so  thin 
13_cell_pos_15	that
13_cell_pos_16	 when  I  put  it  in  the  same  pocket  as  my  wallet  , 
13_cell_pos_17	 I  sometimes  forget 
13_cell_pos_18	 it  's  there  . 
13_cell_pos_19	 -  For  the  cost  , 
13_cell_pos_20	 it  is  pretty  decent  in  terms  of  features  . 
13_cell_pos_21	 128x128  screen  with  fullscreen  graphic  support  ,  10  MB  for  downloads 
13_cell_pos_22	 -LRB-  32  total  -RRB-  ,  speakerphone  ,  web  capability  ,  comparable  performance 
13_cell_pos_23	 to  most  Nokia  series  40  devices  . 
13_cell_pos_24	 Very  long  battery  life  , 
13_cell_pos_25	 and  fast 
13_cell_pos_26	 charging  . 
13_cell_pos_27	 For  those 
13_cell_pos_28	 that  have  had  trouble  with  the  battery 
13_cell_pos_29	 I  suggest 
13_cell_pos_30	 you  try  turning  off  the  backlight  . 
13_cell_pos_31	 It  might  have  .  .  .  interesting  .  .  .  effects  . 
13_cell_pos_32	 -  Uses  the  Sprint  network  . 
13_cell_pos_33	 I  `  ve  found  this  to  be  very  reliable  in  my  area  , 
13_cell_pos_34	 and  signal  quality  is  excellent  both  in  and  outdoors  . 
13_cell_pos_35	 -  Call  quality  is  good  . 
13_cell_pos_36	 Comparable  to  the  8610  as  far  as  I  can  tell  , 
13_cell_pos_37	 which  was  also  good 
13_cell_pos_38	 -LRB-  my  old  Kyocera  ,  on  the  other  hand  ,  was  garbage  -RRB-  . 
13_cell_pos_39	 -  UI  has  a  solid  ,  standard  design  . 
13_cell_pos_40	 Predictive  text  included  for  messaging  . 
13_cell_pos_41	 The  phone  's  graphics  are  a  bit  odd  , 
13_cell_pos_42	 but  not  necessarily  in  a  bad  ways  . 
13_cell_pos_43	 -  Durable  . 
13_cell_pos_44	 UTStarcom  knows 
13_cell_pos_45	 how  to  build  to  last  . 
13_cell_pos_46	 This  handset  is  no  exception  . 
13_cell_pos_47	 -  Good  library  of  games  ,  ringtones  ,  and  graphics  available  . 
13_cell_pos_48	 Now  I  actually  have  something  to  spend  all  that  balance  on  .  .  . 
13_cell_pos_49	 -  Virgin  is  a  very  low  cost  provider  . 
13_cell_pos_50	 It  's  no  good  if  you  want  video  on  demand  ,  3G  ,  or  whatnot  . 
13_cell_pos_51	 But  for  just  making  calls\/texting  now  and  then  , 
13_cell_pos_52	 you  simply  ca  n't  beat  $  20\/3  months  . 
13_cell_pos_53	 No  annual  contract  as  well  , 
13_cell_pos_54	 which  is  a  huge  plus 
13_cell_pos_55	 -LRB-  as  many  who  `  ve  had  one  know  all  too  well  -RRB-  . 
13_cell_pos_56	 On  the  downside  : 
13_cell_pos_57	 -  Keys  are  a  bit  small  . 
13_cell_pos_58	 This  is  typical  of  ultra-thin  handsets  . 
13_cell_pos_59	 They  are  a  bit  stiff  as  well  , 
13_cell_pos_60	 which  is  good  and  bad 
13_cell_pos_61	 -LRB-  good 
13_cell_pos_62	 because  you  wo  n't  accidentally  press  them  as  easily  ,  bad 
13_cell_pos_63	 because  typing  is  more  of  a  pain  -RRB-  . 
13_cell_pos_64	 -  Virgin  's  web  browser  is  lame  . 
13_cell_pos_65	 Their  web  service  costs  extra  , 
13_cell_pos_66	 and  it  has  problems  viewing  many  page  formats 
13_cell_pos_67	 -LRB-  says  '  network  gremlins  ' 
13_cell_pos_68	 when  you  try  .  .  . 
13_cell_pos_69	 cute  -RRB-  . 
13_cell_pos_70	 You  can  browse  basic  html  , 
13_cell_pos_71	 and  that  's  about  it  -  good  luck  reading  e-mail  with  it  . 
13_cell_pos_72	 -  No  bluetooth  built-in  , 
13_cell_pos_73	 though  this  is  to  be  expected  . 
13_cell_pos_74	 -  No  camera  either  ,  also  to  be  expected  . 
13_cell_pos_75	 This  can  actually  be  a  good  thing  , 
13_cell_pos_76	 since  camera  phones  are  off-limits 
13_cell_pos_77	 in  more  areas  than  you  might  expect  . 
13_cell_pos_78	 Bottom  line  : 
13_cell_pos_79	 this  handset  is  great  for  the  price  . 
13_cell_pos_80	 There  are  flaws  with  it  ,  as  with  any  phone  , 
13_cell_pos_81	 but  the  pluses  outweigh  the  minuses  . 
13_cell_pos_82	 I  `  ve  seen  many  reviewers  complain  about  both  Virgin  and  the  phone  , 
13_cell_pos_83	 but  in  my  professional  opinion 
13_cell_pos_84	 -LRB-  and  it  is  an  expert  opinion  -RRB- 
13_cell_pos_85	 these  people  need 
13_cell_pos_86	 to  realize 
13_cell_pos_87	 that  you  get 
13_cell_pos_88	 what  you  pay  for  . 
13_cell_pos_89	 This  is  n't  a  $  200  Samsung  T519  , 
13_cell_pos_90	 and  you  `  re  not  paying  $  60  a  month  for  service  on  a  2  year  contract  . 
13_cell_pos_91	 Considering  the  costs  ,  the  Slice  is  an  great  handset  with  excellent  service  , 
13_cell_pos_92	 and  that  is  that 
17_cell_pos_1	 This  is  a  great  phone 
17_cell_pos_2	 that  I  `  ve  used  for  a  year 
17_cell_pos_3	 now  . 
17_cell_pos_4	 I  'd  like  to  highlight  the  standout  features 
17_cell_pos_5	 that  make  this  phone  unique  ,  especially  at  its  price  . 
17_cell_pos_6	 MP3  player  . 
17_cell_pos_7	 Just  get  an  adapter  for  the  usb  port 
17_cell_pos_8	 -LRB-  a  few  bucks  on  eBay  -RRB- 
17_cell_pos_9	and
17_cell_pos_10	 you  can  plug  in  your  stereo  headphones  . 
17_cell_pos_11	 Too  bad  they  have  n't  offered  an  update  to  the  Motorola  Digital  Audio  Player  . 
17_cell_pos_12	 MicroSD  slot  . 
17_cell_pos_13	 You  can  take  a  MicroSD  card  ,  put  it  into  the  included  adapter 
17_cell_pos_14	 and  plug  into  an  SD  slot 
17_cell_pos_15	 on  your  computer  and  copy  MP3s 
17_cell_pos_16	 -LRB-  you  can  take  any  mp3 
17_cell_pos_17	 and  make  it  your  ringtone  , 
17_cell_pos_18	cropping
17_cell_pos_19	 it  will  make 
17_cell_pos_20	 it  more  effective  -RRB-  ,  3GP  videos 
17_cell_pos_21	 -LRB-  animation  looks  great  , 
17_cell_pos_22	 but  the  sound  was  slightly  out  of  sync  ,  search  the  web  for  video  converters  to  convert  your  content  -RRB-  ,  or  pictures  . 
17_cell_pos_23	 I  love 
17_cell_pos_24	 making  my  own  ringtones 
17_cell_pos_25	 and  not  having  to  buy  them  . 
17_cell_pos_26	 Bluetooth  . 
17_cell_pos_27	 I  got  an  Explorer  320  headset  for  $  20 
17_cell_pos_28	and
17_cell_pos_29	 it  works  great  with  it  . 
17_cell_pos_30	 Battery  . 
17_cell_pos_31	 Easily  exchangeable  . 
17_cell_pos_32	 Easily  slide  off  the  cover  and  pop  in  a  fresh  one  . 
17_cell_pos_33	 The  battery  life  is  n't  very  long  , 
17_cell_pos_34	 so  it  's  good  to  have  a  spare  battery  , 
17_cell_pos_35	 they  `  re  cheap  . 
17_cell_pos_36	 Video  camera  . 
17_cell_pos_37	 Not  high  quality  video  , 
17_cell_pos_38	 but  its  something  the  old  RAZR  could  n't  do  . 
17_cell_pos_39	 Customization  . 
17_cell_pos_40	 I  love  customization  . 
17_cell_pos_41	 You  can  set  up  the  hotkey  on  the  side  of  the  phone  ,  the  two  on  the  top  of  the  keypad  ,  and  the  directional  pad  to  go  directly  to  most  functions  of  the  phone  . 
17_cell_pos_42	 It  even  has  a  shortcut  list  to  list  all  your  favorite  features  . 
17_cell_pos_43	 You  can  easily  make  any  picture 
17_cell_pos_44	 including  pics 
17_cell_pos_45	 you  take  into  your  wallpaper  . 
17_cell_pos_46	 Also  you  can  find  replacement  faceplates  to  make  your  phone  unique  . 
17_cell_pos_47	 Speakerphone  . 
17_cell_pos_48	 Works  even  when  closed  . 
17_cell_pos_49	 Good  for  using  automated  phone  menu  systems  and 
17_cell_pos_50	 when  you  `  re  put  on  hold  . 
17_cell_pos_51	 The  speaker  is  loud  and  great  for  ringtones  and  mp3s  . 
17_cell_pos_52	 The  plastic  may  resonate  at  certain  sounds  though  . 
17_cell_pos_53	 Vibrating  alert  . 
17_cell_pos_54	 VIBE  THEN  RING  ! 
17_cell_pos_55	 Why  does  n't  every  phone  have  this  ?  ? 
17_cell_pos_56	 It  should  be  the  default  standard  for  all  phones  . 
17_cell_pos_57	 The  vibration  is  definitely  strong  enough  to  feel  in  a  pocket  . 
17_cell_pos_58	 If  you  are  one 
17_cell_pos_59	 to  show  off  your  ringtone  ,  let 
17_cell_pos_60	 it  move  onto  ring  ,  otherwise  be  descreet 
17_cell_pos_61	 and  answer  immediately  . 
17_cell_pos_62	-----------------------------------------------------------
17_cell_pos_63	 As  for  what  I  do  n't  like  . 
17_cell_pos_64	 I  do  n't  care  much  for  the  Motorola  menu  style  . 
17_cell_pos_65	 I  prefer  Sanyo  and  Samsung  interfaces  . 
17_cell_pos_66	 The  menu  is  the  same  as  a  RAZR  or  SLVR  . 
17_cell_pos_67	 All  the  lettering  on  the  outside  as  well  as  some  case  paint  has  rubbed  off  . 
17_cell_pos_68	 I  carry  my  phone  in  my  pocket  so  the  phone  has  aged  a  bit  . 
17_cell_pos_69	 I  scraped  off  the  remainder 
17_cell_pos_70	 of  the  lettering  so  it  would  n't  look  half 
17_cell_pos_71	 worn  off  . 
17_cell_pos_72	-----------------------------------------------------------
17_cell_pos_73	 All  the  great  features  is  what  keeps  me  from  getting  a  Samsung  t509  or  other  more  expensive  phones  . 
17_cell_pos_74	 This  phone  just  has  all  the  fee-free  features  you  could  want 
12_gourmet_neg_1	 The  description  for  this  item  is  not  accurate  . 
12_gourmet_neg_2	 I  bought 
12_gourmet_neg_3	 the  freeze  deied  raspberries  and  stawberries  from  this  same  company  and  they  are  great  . 
12_gourmet_neg_4	 However  ,  these  are  dehydrated 
12_gourmet_neg_5	 which  means  2  important  things  : 
12_gourmet_neg_6	 -  Texture  : 
12_gourmet_neg_7	 these  are  very  hard  and  do  not  soften  if  left  in  milk  or  water  . 
12_gourmet_neg_8	 Do  n't  think  about  adding  these  to  cereal  ,  only  for  trail  mix  or  eating  out  of  hand  . 
12_gourmet_neg_9	 -  Saturated  fat  : 
12_gourmet_neg_10	 the  second  ingredient  is  coconut  oil  ! 
12_gourmet_neg_11	 One  2oz  . 
12_gourmet_neg_12	 serving  has  190  calories  ,  19  grams  of  fat 
12_gourmet_neg_13	 and  16  grams  of  saturated  fat  . 
12_gourmet_neg_14	 You  `  re  better  off  eating  Cheetos  . 
12_gourmet_neg_15	 These  are  extremely  unhealthy  and  do  n't  even  taste  that  great  . 
12_gourmet_neg_16	 There  is  -LRB-  unsurprisingly  -RRB- 
12_gourmet_neg_17	 and  oily  aftertaste  . 
12_gourmet_neg_18	 Buyer  beware  . 
12_gourmet_neg_19	 Stick  to  purely  freeze  dried  fruits 
12_gourmet_neg_20	 -  nothing  is  added 
12_gourmet_neg_21	 and  they  are  healthy 
5_gourmet_neg_1	 The  product  description  says 
5_gourmet_neg_2	 that  this  tea  is  '  slightly  sweet  '  as  well  as  a  bunch  of  other  descriptors  , 
5_gourmet_neg_3	 but  I  did  n't  get  any  sweetness  at  all  . 
5_gourmet_neg_4	 I  was  very  optimistic 
5_gourmet_neg_5	 because  I  normally  love  everything  Tazo  offers  , 
5_gourmet_neg_6	 but  this  time  I  had  my  hopes 
5_gourmet_neg_7	 dashed  . 
5_gourmet_neg_8	 I  brewed  up  a  mug  of  this  tea 
5_gourmet_neg_9	 and  was  immediately  alarmed  at  the  bouquet  . 
5_gourmet_neg_10	 The  teabag  smelled  different  , 
5_gourmet_neg_11	 but  once  the  hot  water  hit  it  the  smell  seemed  to  really  magnify  . 
5_gourmet_neg_12	 But  I  scooped  in  a  few  teaspoons  of  sugar 
5_gourmet_neg_13	 and  hoped  for  the  best  . 
5_gourmet_neg_14	 I  managed  to  choke  down  about  a  third  of  the  cup 
5_gourmet_neg_15	 before  I  called  it  a  day  . 
5_gourmet_neg_16	 Life  is  too  short  to  drink  something 
5_gourmet_neg_17	 you  do  n't  like  . 
5_gourmet_neg_18	 However  , 
5_gourmet_neg_19	 I  had  read  a  review 
5_gourmet_neg_20	 that  mentioned 
5_gourmet_neg_21	 how  good  and  palatable  this  tea  was 
5_gourmet_neg_22	 when  combined  with  the  Tazo  Lotus  . 
5_gourmet_neg_23	 I  figured 
5_gourmet_neg_24	 it  was  worth  a  shot  ,  otherwise 
5_gourmet_neg_25	 I  'd  have  to  throw  out  this  tea  altogether  . 
5_gourmet_neg_26	 The  Lotus  smelled  great  , 
5_gourmet_neg_27	 so  I  was  excited  . 
5_gourmet_neg_28	 I  blended  the  two  bags 
5_gourmet_neg_29	 -LRB-  one  Lotus  and  one  Wild  Sweet  Orange  -RRB- 
5_gourmet_neg_30	 in  a  large  mug  , 
5_gourmet_neg_31	 then  removed  the  Wild  Sweet  Orange  after  a  minute  . 
5_gourmet_neg_32	 I  left  the  Lotus  in  for  another  minute  or  two 
5_gourmet_neg_33	 -LRB-  yeah  ,  definitely  two  -RRB-  . 
5_gourmet_neg_34	 The  result  was  a  very  unusual  , 
5_gourmet_neg_35	 but  not  unappealing  , 
5_gourmet_neg_36	 beverage  . 
5_gourmet_neg_37	 Would  I  drink  this  more  than  once  a  day  ? 
5_gourmet_neg_38	 No  . 
5_gourmet_neg_39	 Was  it  very  interesting  and  something  that 
5_gourmet_neg_40	 I  `  ll  try  again  ? 
5_gourmet_neg_41	 Yes  . 
5_gourmet_neg_42	 Live  and  learn  , 
5_gourmet_neg_43	 I  guess  . 
16_gourmet_pos_1	\*\*\*\*
16_gourmet_pos_2	 Tazo  's  Lotus  Decaffeinated  Green  Tea  is  one  of  my  favorite  Tazo  teas  . 
16_gourmet_pos_3	 The  lotus  flower  flavor  is  pleasant  and  delightful  . 
16_gourmet_pos_4	 This  tea  is  not  bitter  or  harsh  in  any  way  . 
16_gourmet_pos_5	 It  is  one  of  the  most  natural-tasting  of  the  Tazo  's  I  `  ve  tasted  ,  very  subtle  , 
16_gourmet_pos_6	 and  much  less  artificial-tasting  . 
16_gourmet_pos_7	 The  ingredients  in  Lotus  are  : 
16_gourmet_pos_8	 naturally  decaffeinated  green  tea  ,  natural  lotus  flower  flavor  and  other  natural  flavors  . 
16_gourmet_pos_9	 Of  course  ,  this  tea  is  caffeine-free  . 
16_gourmet_pos_10	 Tazo  is  an  interesting  company 
16_gourmet_pos_11	 that  makes  only  super  premium  teas  . 
16_gourmet_pos_12	 They  are  socially  responsible  , 
16_gourmet_pos_13	" ""based  in  Portland  ,  and  have  the  motto  ,  """"  The  Reincarnation  of  Tea  """"  ."" "
16_gourmet_pos_14	 Tazo  is  owned  by  Starbucks  . 
16_gourmet_pos_15	 Their  web  site  is  fun  and  quirky  ,  with  a  Zen-type  focus  ,  definitely  worth  checking  out  . 
16_gourmet_pos_16	 It  is  unclear  , 
16_gourmet_pos_17	 though  ,  from  their  web  site  , 
16_gourmet_pos_18	 how  many  of  their  ingredients  are  organic  or  kosher  , 
16_gourmet_pos_19	" ""and  they  do  use  some  """"  natural  flavors  """""" "
16_gourmet_pos_20	 in  their  teas 
16_gourmet_pos_21	--
16_gourmet_pos_22	 this  wording  seems  a  little  vague  for  a  super  premium  tea  . 
16_gourmet_pos_23	 On  the  paper  tea  packet  , 
16_gourmet_pos_24	 Tazo  writes  ,

17_gourmet_pos_2	 Tazo  's  Lotus  Decaffeinated  Green  Tea  is  one  of  my  favorite  Tazo  teas  . 
17_gourmet_pos_3	 The  lotus  flower  flavor  is  pleasant  and  delightful  . 
17_gourmet_pos_4	 This  tea  is  not  bitter  or  harsh  in  any  way  . 
17_gourmet_pos_5	 It  is  one  of  the  most  natural-tasting  of  the  Tazo  's  I  `  ve  tasted  ,  very  subtle  , 
17_gourmet_pos_6	 and  much  less  artificial-tasting  . 
17_gourmet_pos_7	 The  ingredients  in  Lotus  are  : 
17_gourmet_pos_8	 naturally  decaffeinated  green  tea  ,  natural  lotus  flower  flavor  and  other  natural  flavors  . 
17_gourmet_pos_9	 Of  course  ,  this  tea  is  caffeine-free  .

17_gourmet_pos_11	 that  makes  only  super  premium  teas  .

17_kitchen_neg_1	 I  `  ve  own  my  X3  for  about  2  years  now 
17_kitchen_neg_2	 and  overall  , 
17_kitchen_neg_3	 it  has  been  used  to  make  one  double  espresso  daily  . 
17_kitchen_neg_4	So
17_kitchen_neg_5	 when  it  stopped  working  a  month  ago  , 
17_kitchen_neg_6	 I  was  heartbroken  . 
17_kitchen_neg_7	 Called  FF  , 
17_kitchen_neg_8	 after  some  back  and  forth  I  sent  the  machine  in  for  repair  . 
17_kitchen_neg_9	 The  cost  of  repairing  it  is  about  $  200  ,  incl  . 
17_kitchen_neg_10	 the  shipping  . 
17_kitchen_neg_11	 Add  that  to  the  $  499  I  paid  for  it 
17_kitchen_neg_12	 and  this  turns  out  to  be  one  very  expensive  machine  . 
17_kitchen_neg_13	 After  several  days  of  back  and  forth  with  customer  service  , 
17_kitchen_neg_14	 I  still  do  n't  know  what  exactly  is  not  working  in  my  machine  . 
17_kitchen_neg_15	 Apparently  , 
17_kitchen_neg_16	 there  are  3  items 
17_kitchen_neg_17	 that  have  failed  , 
17_kitchen_neg_18	 one  being  the  thermostat  ,  a  washer  and  something  else  , 
17_kitchen_neg_19	 that  CS  was  unable  to  explain  . 
17_kitchen_neg_20	 I  really  liked  the  machine 
17_kitchen_neg_21	 when  it  was  working  , 
17_kitchen_neg_22	 so  I  gave  it  some  serious  thought  of  shelling  for  repair  , 
17_kitchen_neg_23	 but  at  the  end  decided  against  it  - 
17_kitchen_neg_24	 I  rather  purchase  a  new  Rancilio  Silvia  . 
17_kitchen_neg_25	 When  I  called  the  CS  with  me  decision 
17_kitchen_neg_26	 and  asked  them  to  send  the  machine  back  ,  I  was  told 
17_kitchen_neg_27	 that  on  top  of  the  $  12  shipping 
17_kitchen_neg_28	 there  will  be  a  $  13  handling  charge  for  packaging  the  machine  . 
17_kitchen_neg_29	 I  refused  to  pay  that 
17_kitchen_neg_30	 and  the  rep  turned  outright  nasty  . 
17_kitchen_neg_31	 Long  story  short  , 
17_kitchen_neg_32	 I  finally  got  them  to  send  the  machine  back  with  just  a  shipping  charge  ,  but  that  was  one  very  unpleasant  experience  . 
17_kitchen_neg_33	 It  is  a  whole 
17_kitchen_neg_34	 another  issue 
17_kitchen_neg_35	 what  additional  damage  they  might  have  done  to  my  machine 
17_kitchen_neg_36	 after  the  nasty  fight 
17_kitchen_neg_37	 I  had  with  them  . 
17_kitchen_neg_38	 I  really  liked  the  X3 
17_kitchen_neg_39	 when  it  was  working  , 
17_kitchen_neg_40	 and  I  would  love  to  have  it  back  , 
17_kitchen_neg_41	 but  it  is  just  not  cost  effective  at  all  . 
17_kitchen_neg_42	 What  is  really  confusing  to  me  is  that  with  the  low  usage  my  machine  had  and  the  maintenance  I  provided  , 
17_kitchen_neg_43	 it  has  3  parts 
17_kitchen_neg_44	 needing  replacement 
17_kitchen_neg_45	 -  if  this  was  a  good  quality  machine  , 
17_kitchen_neg_46	 it  should  have  worked  a  lot  longer  without  any  problems  . 
3_kitchen_neg_1	 My  wife  got  this  Cuisinart  Classic  Toaster  oven  as  a  wedding  gift  . 
3_kitchen_neg_2	 We  liked  the  appearance 
3_kitchen_neg_3	 and  had  it  on  our  registry  . 
3_kitchen_neg_4	 We  used  this  toaster  oven  a  lot 
3_kitchen_neg_5	 because  it  cooked  very  well  . 
3_kitchen_neg_6	 Toast  was  perfect  , 
3_kitchen_neg_7	 and  the  oven 
3_kitchen_neg_8	 cooked  nice  and  hot  . 
3_kitchen_neg_9	 We  broiled  meats 
3_kitchen_neg_10	 and  made  all  kind  of  things  in  it  . 
3_kitchen_neg_11	 We  found  it  hard  to  clean  . 
3_kitchen_neg_12	 We  would  take  the  baking  pan\/and  crumb  tray 
3_kitchen_neg_13	 and  use  our  regular  self 
3_kitchen_neg_14	 cleaning  oven 
3_kitchen_neg_15	 to  clean  those  , 
3_kitchen_neg_16	 but  it  would  take  a  lot  of  scrubbing  to  clean  the  glass  and  interior  of  the  oven  . 
3_kitchen_neg_17	 Then  after  about  1  year  one  of  the  plastic  feet  broke  off 
3_kitchen_neg_18	 when  simply  adjusting  the  position  of  the  oven  on  the  counter  . 
3_kitchen_neg_19	 I  glued 
3_kitchen_neg_20	 it  back  on  with  super  glue  . 
3_kitchen_neg_21	 It  broke  again 
3_kitchen_neg_22	 and  seemed  to  become  more  brittle  over  time  because  of  the  heat  so  I  had  to  fix  this  plastic  foot  a  few  times  . 
3_kitchen_neg_23	 Then  another  problem  arose  . 
3_kitchen_neg_24	 The  toaster  and  the  one  light  would  shut  off  a  few  second  after  pressing  start  . 
3_kitchen_neg_25	 So  to  make  toast 
3_kitchen_neg_26	 we  just  used  the  un-timed  bake  function  , 
3_kitchen_neg_27	 but  then  we  would  have  to  watch  so  we  did  not  burn  the  toast  . 
3_kitchen_neg_28	 Still  we  lived  with  it  . 
3_kitchen_neg_29	 Then  after  about  another  four  months  all  of  the  controls  stopped  working  . 
3_kitchen_neg_30	 So  it  does  not  bake  . 
3_kitchen_neg_31	 I  think 
3_kitchen_neg_32	 I  knew 
3_kitchen_neg_33	 this  was  going  to  happen 
3_kitchen_neg_34	 because  I  would  hear  a  strange  buzz 
3_kitchen_neg_35	 and  see  a  little  smoke  come  off 
3_kitchen_neg_36	 when  ever  I  turned  the  dial 
3_kitchen_neg_37	 to  bake  for  a  while  . 
3_kitchen_neg_38	 So  therefore  I  think 
3_kitchen_neg_39	 the  electrical  wiring  was  not  heavy  duty  enough  or  the  electrical  system  was  not  soldered  well  or  protected  well  enough  to  last  . 
3_kitchen_neg_40	 I  would  have  expected  better  quality  . 
3_kitchen_neg_41	 Considering  how  long  we  have  been  making  toaster  ovens  , 
3_kitchen_neg_42	 I  think 
3_kitchen_neg_43	 that  it  would  have  not  been  too  hard  for  them  to  have  made  a  more  heavy  duty  electrical  system  for  the  controls  . 
3_kitchen_neg_44	 So  like  other  reviews  say  , 
3_kitchen_neg_45	 it  does  cook  well  and  evenly  , 
3_kitchen_neg_46	 but  it  is  hard  to  clean  and  does  not  last  . 
3_kitchen_neg_47	 If  I  were  to  have  rated  the  product  before  the  problems  started  I  would  have  given  it  4  stars  . 
3_kitchen_neg_48	 I  wish  that  Amazon  and  these  sites  had  a  section  for  long  term  reviews 
3_kitchen_neg_49	 that  would  rate  the  quality  , 
3_kitchen_neg_50	 because  most  of  the  reviews  seem  to  be  written  soon  after  receiving  the  products  . 
3_kitchen_neg_51	 We  are  now  looking  into  T-Fall  Convection  Toaster  oven  , 
3_kitchen_neg_52	 but  after  reading  those  reviews 
3_kitchen_neg_53	 we  do  not  know  if  it  cooks  as  hot  as  this  oven 
3_kitchen_neg_54	 and  we  want  to  get  one 
3_kitchen_neg_55	 that  cooks  well 
3_kitchen_neg_56	 and  lasts  . 
3_kitchen_neg_57	______________
3_kitchen_neg_58	 Since  writing  my  review  above 
3_kitchen_neg_59	 I  tried  to  fix  my  oven  to  no  avail  , 
3_kitchen_neg_60	 but  I  have  gained  more  insight  into  its  design 
3_kitchen_neg_61	 and  perhaps 
3_kitchen_neg_62	 why  it  broke  . 
3_kitchen_neg_63	 My  recommendations  are  as  follows  . 
3_kitchen_neg_64	 Since  I  know 
3_kitchen_neg_65	" ""that  the  rotary  controls  and  the  circuit  board  of  this  """"  Classic  """"  model  product  can  over  time  get  dirty  and  stop  working  ,"" "
3_kitchen_neg_66	 I  recommend  that  people  who  own  this  oven  keep  it  far  away  from  any  other  cooking  products 
3_kitchen_neg_67	 that  create  grease  or  steam  such  as  range  tops  ,  rice  cookers  ,  deep  fryers  ,  pressure  cookers  ,  or  kitchen  sinks  . 
3_kitchen_neg_68	 Especially  keep  the  vents  near  the  controls  on  the  right  side  of  this  unit  away  from  these  sources  of  moisture  and  grease  . 
3_kitchen_neg_69	 I  recommend  consumers  to  consider  the  newer  models  with  digital  controls  , 
3_kitchen_neg_70	 which  might  have  a  different  mechanism  inside  or  the  models  with  the  controls  beneath 
3_kitchen_neg_71	 and  therefore  the  electrical  components 
3_kitchen_neg_72	 and  cooling  vents  underneath  the  oven  and  not  in  an  exposed  location  . 
3_kitchen_neg_73	 This  might  make  the  unit  last  longer  . 
3_kitchen_neg_74	 The  newer  Cuisinart  models  with  the  knobs  or  digital  controls  beneath  the  oven  might  be  a  design  improvement  to  correct  the  sort  of  problem 
3_kitchen_neg_75	 I  had  . 
3_kitchen_neg_76	 Or  perhaps  other  manufactures  have  solved  electrical  component  problem  other  ways  . 
3_kitchen_neg_77	 Maybe  1.5  years  is  average  life  ,  or  maybe  the  fact 
3_kitchen_neg_78	 that  my  oven  was  placed  near  the  cooking  range  in  my  kitchen 
3_kitchen_neg_79	 made  my  unit  more  susceptible  to  malfunction  . 
3_kitchen_neg_80	 Reviews  of  lots  of  other  brand  models  show  short  life  spans  for  these  products  . 
3_kitchen_neg_81	 From  the  reviews  and  my  observations  above  , 
3_kitchen_neg_82	 I  think 
3_kitchen_neg_83	 the  Krups  models  and  the  improved  Cuisinart  models  might  last  a  longer  time  than  this  classic  model 
3_kitchen_neg_84	 that  died  on  me  . 
12_kitchen_pos_1	 When  I  adopted  a  cat  a  couple  of  weeks  ago  ,  two  of  my  good  friends  highly  recommended  Fresh  Step  Premium  Clay  Cat  Litter  . 
12_kitchen_pos_2	 Here  's  why  -- 
12_kitchen_pos_3	 This  Fresh  Step  Premium  Clay  Cat  Litter  is  excellent  for  your  favorite  kitty  's  litter  box  . 
12_kitchen_pos_4	 The  company  states  that  it  is  very  good  at  absorbing  odors 
12_kitchen_pos_5	--
12_kitchen_pos_6	 and  ,  by  golly  , 
12_kitchen_pos_7	 it  's  TRUE  ! 
12_kitchen_pos_8	 The  odors  are  minimal  at  the  very  most  and  it  is  quite  comfortable  even  for  my  rather  sensitive  cat  . 
12_kitchen_pos_9	 Moreover  , 
12_kitchen_pos_10	 I  really  like  how  the  litter  has  the  capacity  to  absorb  and  prevent  odor 
12_kitchen_pos_11	 causing  bacteria  in  the  litter 
12_kitchen_pos_12	 before  my  cat  even  uses  his  litter  box  . 
12_kitchen_pos_13	 That  's  a  plus  for  any  cat  lover  ! 
12_kitchen_pos_14	 If  you  have  more  than  one  cat  the  manufacturer  does  recommend  ,  not  surprisingly  , 
12_kitchen_pos_15	 that  you  use  more  cat  litter  in  the  box  . 
12_kitchen_pos_16	 Otherwise  , 
12_kitchen_pos_17	 if  you  have  just  one  cat  ,  two  or  three  inches  worth  of  this  cat  litter 
12_kitchen_pos_18	 spread  about  evenly  throughout  the  empty  litter  box  will  do  fine  . 
12_kitchen_pos_19	 You  should  change  the  entire  litter  box  once  a  week  on  average  . 
12_kitchen_pos_20	 -LRB-  I  change  mine  about  twice  a  week  just  for  my  cat  's  comfort  .  -RRB- 
12_kitchen_pos_21	 It  's  also  a  good  idea 
12_kitchen_pos_22	" ""to  scoop  out  any  """"  kitty  remains  """""" "
12_kitchen_pos_23	 every  other  day  or  so  . 
12_kitchen_pos_24	" ""Be  very  certain  NOT  to  flush  any  """"  kitty  presents  """""" "
12_kitchen_pos_25	 down  the  toilet  as  the  manufacturer  warns  against  this  . 
12_kitchen_pos_26	 I  suppose  it  could  clog  toilet  pipes  . 
12_kitchen_pos_27	 Moreover  , 
12_kitchen_pos_28	 as  you  may  suspect  , 
12_kitchen_pos_29	" ""any  """"  kitty  leftovers  """""" "
12_kitchen_pos_30	 could  have  some  nasty  germs

12_kitchen_pos_33	 with  a  scooper  . 
12_kitchen_pos_34	 The  fact  that  this  is  clay  litter  helps 
12_kitchen_pos_35	 because  you  can  use  a  very  inexpensive  litter  scooper 
12_kitchen_pos_36	" ""to  remove  any  """"  kitty  presents  ,  """"  thus  reducing  the  number  the  times"" "
12_kitchen_pos_37	 you  need 
12_kitchen_pos_38	 to  change  the  entire  kitty  litter  box  . 
12_kitchen_pos_39	 Nevertheless  , 
12_kitchen_pos_40	 I  recommend 
12_kitchen_pos_41	 changing  the  entire  litter  box  at  least  once  a  week  . 
12_kitchen_pos_42	 Place  the  contents  of  the  used  litter  box  into  a  trash  bag 
12_kitchen_pos_43	 and  discard  as  you  would  any  other  garbage  . 
12_kitchen_pos_44	 In  short  , 
12_kitchen_pos_45	 this  is  a  great  cat  litter  product  at  a  great  price  . 
12_kitchen_pos_46	 The  contents  of  the  bag  last  a  long  time  , 
12_kitchen_pos_47	 especially  if  ,  like  me  , 
12_kitchen_pos_48	 you  have  only  one  cat  . 
12_kitchen_pos_49	 The  manufacturer  also  offers  customers 
12_kitchen_pos_50	 -LRB-  us  ,  not  the  cats  -RRB-

2_kitchen_pos_12	 -LRB-  at  least  as  of  this  writing  -RRB- 
2_kitchen_pos_13	seems
2_kitchen_pos_14	 to  indicate 
2_kitchen_pos_15	 that  it  has  one  as  well  . 
2_kitchen_pos_16	 I  can  tell  you  outright 
2_kitchen_pos_17	that
2_kitchen_pos_18	 having  checked  with  the  manufacturer  directly 
2_kitchen_pos_19	" ""and  now  owning  one  myself  that  it  does  \*  NOT  \*  have  a  """"  HEPA  """"  filter  ."" "
2_kitchen_pos_20	 More  on  that  a  little  later  in  this  review  however  . 
2_kitchen_pos_21	 I  found  another  confusing  aspect  of  the  description 
2_kitchen_pos_22	 is  in  the  model  number 
2_kitchen_pos_23	 -LRB-  i.  e  . 
2_kitchen_pos_24	 3670G  -RRB-  . 
2_kitchen_pos_25	 Be  careful  to  understand  the  difference  between  what  Amazon  calls  the  3670  -LRB-  also  called  the  3670A  in  some  places  -RRB- 
2_kitchen_pos_26	 and  the  3670  \*  G  \*  models  . 
2_kitchen_pos_27	 They  look  identical 
2_kitchen_pos_28	 and  appear  to  be  identical 
2_kitchen_pos_29	 -LRB-  both  are  yellow  and  black  -RRB- 
2_kitchen_pos_30	however
2_kitchen_pos_31	 the  3670  only  has  a  9  amp  motor 
2_kitchen_pos_32	 and  the  3670G  has  the  larger  ,  12  amp  motor  . 
2_kitchen_pos_33	 Amazon  carries  both  models 
2_kitchen_pos_34	 and  I  almost  ended  up 
2_kitchen_pos_35	 buying  the  smaller  one  thinking 
2_kitchen_pos_36	 it  was  the  same  vacuum  . 
2_kitchen_pos_37	 For  only  about  a  $  5  -  $  10  difference  in  total  price  , 
2_kitchen_pos_38	 I  'm  not  sure 
2_kitchen_pos_39	 why  the  smaller  version  is  even  offered  . 
2_kitchen_pos_40	 It  only  seems  to  confuse  the  matter  . 
2_kitchen_pos_41	" ""The  3670  also  does  \*  NOT  \*  have  the  """"  HEPA  """"  filter  incidentally  ."" "
2_kitchen_pos_42	 I  found  the  3670G  to  be  an  excellent  value  however 
2_kitchen_pos_43	 and  am  pleased  with  my  purchase  . 
2_kitchen_pos_44	 It  is  compact  ,  very  powerful  and  great  for  my  needs  . 
2_kitchen_pos_45	 The  noise  .  .  .  while  high  .  .  .  is  quite  tolerable  and  not  at  all  excessive 
2_kitchen_pos_46	considering
2_kitchen_pos_47	 how  well  it  cleans  . 
2_kitchen_pos_48	 The  generously  long  cord  wraps  easily  around  the  base  for  storage 
2_kitchen_pos_49	 and  while  a  retractable  cord  would  have  been  extremely  useful  , 
2_kitchen_pos_50	 not  having  one  is  a  reasonable  trade-off  in  keeping  the  price  down  . 
2_kitchen_pos_51	 The  blower  port  feature  is  very  handy  for  cleaning  my  computer  insides 
2_kitchen_pos_52	 -LRB-  by  blowing  away  dust 
2_kitchen_pos_53	 without  contacting  electrical  components 
2_kitchen_pos_54	 as  vacuuming  would  risk  doing  -RRB-  . 
2_kitchen_pos_55	 The  3670G  \*  does  \*  require  bags  . 
2_kitchen_pos_56	" ""It  is  not  a  """"  bagless  """"  model  however"" "
2_kitchen_pos_57	 and  while  some  may  prefer  a  bagless  model  , 
2_kitchen_pos_58	 I  preferred  a  model 
2_kitchen_pos_59	 that  used  bags  . 
2_kitchen_pos_60	 The  bags  are  very  easy  to  change  on  this  model  and  not  that  much  of  an  additional  expense 
2_kitchen_pos_61	 for  what  I  consider  to  be  the  additional  convenience 
2_kitchen_pos_62	 -LRB-  of  being  able  to  easily  remove  and  dispose  of  a  bag  -RRB-  . 
2_kitchen_pos_63	 The  only  reason  I  gave  this  model  4  stars  and  not  5  was  because  I  did  not  find  the  attachment  brushes  quite  adequate  . 
2_kitchen_pos_64	" ""Three  attachment  tools  are  included  ,  a  crevice  tool  ,  a  10  """"  floor  tool"" "

2_kitchen_pos_67	 on  the  end  .

2_kitchen_pos_71	 In  my  opinion  ,  this  cleaner  badly  needs  a  mid-sized  brush

2_kitchen_pos_77	 I  found 
2_kitchen_pos_78	 that  I  simply  had  to  move  it  much  too  frequently  on  larger  surfaces

2_kitchen_pos_99	 Since  many  online  descriptions  I  found  were  unclear

2_kitchen_pos_101	 -LRB-  some  descriptions  flatly  stated  that  it  does  -RRB-  , 
2_kitchen_pos_102	 I  found  myself 
2_kitchen_pos_103	 calling  the  Eureka  customer  service  number  to  find  out  for  sure  . 
2_kitchen_pos_104	 It  turned  out 
2_kitchen_pos_105	 that  even  Eureka  's  own  customer  service  representative  was  unsure 
2_kitchen_pos_106	 whether  it  contained  the  filter  or  not  and  had  to  take  some  considerable  time  to  find  out  that  it  did  n't  have  one  . 
2_kitchen_pos_107	" ""If  you  \*  do  \*  want  the  """"  HEPA  """"  filter  ,"" "
2_kitchen_pos_108	 you  would  want  the  3684D  .  .  .

2_kitchen_pos_111	 By  the  time

2_kitchen_pos_114	 which  I  mentioned  earlier 
2_kitchen_pos_115	 that  I  think

2_kitchen_pos_117	 you  are  at  the  price  of  a  3684D  .
