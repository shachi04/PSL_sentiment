15_gourmet_neg_1	As a vegan ,
15_gourmet_neg_2	I have tried just about every tofu product on the market , and nothing ever came close to the terrible texture of these noodles .
15_gourmet_neg_3	The smell
15_gourmet_neg_4	when you opened the bag was not pleasant ,
15_gourmet_neg_5	but if you wash them off
15_gourmet_neg_6	and parboil ,
15_gourmet_neg_7	that goes away ,
15_gourmet_neg_8	but is replaced with a slightly sweet smell that I disliked almost as much .
15_gourmet_neg_9	But I kept an open mind ,
15_gourmet_neg_10	cooked the noodles for a few minutes , added my favorite sauce and fresh ground pepper with some soy cheese
15_gourmet_neg_11	grated on top .
15_gourmet_neg_12	Whoever said
15_gourmet_neg_13	it was like eating rubber bands was exactly on target ,
15_gourmet_neg_14	they are incredibly chewy and just do n't taste that great either .
15_gourmet_neg_15	Even as a low calorie food ,
15_gourmet_neg_16	it seems like a waste
15_gourmet_neg_17	to spend 40 calories on these noodles .
