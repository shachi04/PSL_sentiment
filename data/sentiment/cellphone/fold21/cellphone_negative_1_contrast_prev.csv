1_cell_neg_3	negative	False	1_cell_neg_2	There are many pros and cons about this device and the service that it is shackled to .
1_cell_neg_4	negative	False	1_cell_neg_3	I will break it down to Hardware , Software and Cell Phone Service Provider .
1_cell_neg_5	positive	False	1_cell_neg_4	Hardware Pro 's :
1_cell_neg_6	positive	False	1_cell_neg_5	A lot has been written about this aspect of the device , so I ` ll keep this to a minimum - The best form factor

1_cell_neg_11	positive	False	1_cell_neg_10	- A key selling point for me was the combined Bluetooth , Wi-Fi and quad-band connectivity
1_cell_neg_12	positive	False	1_cell_neg_11	that enabled me to connect a wireless headset , cruise web pages
1_cell_neg_13	positive	False	1_cell_neg_12	and have access

1_cell_neg_25	negative	False	1_cell_neg_24	while a little small ,
1_cell_neg_26	positive	False	1_cell_neg_25	is crystal clear and surprisingly easy to use given its size .
1_cell_neg_27	positive	False	1_cell_neg_26	- The camera is pretty good and it 's been really great
1_cell_neg_28	positive	False	1_cell_neg_27	emailing photo 's to people as I 'm traveling around .
1_cell_neg_29	negative	False	1_cell_neg_28	After all of the cons
1_cell_neg_30	negative	False	1_cell_neg_29	that you ` ll read below you
1_cell_neg_31	negative	False	1_cell_neg_30	` ll wonder
1_cell_neg_32	negative	False	1_cell_neg_31	why I ever bought the device
1_cell_neg_33	negative	False	1_cell_neg_32	and why I still use it .
1_cell_neg_34	negative	False	1_cell_neg_33	Well here it is :
1_cell_neg_35	negative	False	1_cell_neg_34	1 . T-Mobile locked me into a 2 year contract on a very expensive device .
1_cell_neg_36	positive	False	1_cell_neg_35	2 . It has great hardware
1_cell_neg_37	positive	False	1_cell_neg_36	that I can use in the US and Europe ,
1_cell_neg_38	negative	False	1_cell_neg_37	I 'm just hoping
1_cell_neg_39	negative	False	1_cell_neg_38	that Microsoft will finally get
1_cell_neg_40	negative	False	1_cell_neg_39	it right .
1_cell_neg_41	negative	False	1_cell_neg_40	Hardware Con 's
1_cell_neg_42	negative	False	1_cell_neg_41	- The touch sensitive volume button is the most ill-conceived feature
1_cell_neg_43	positive	False	1_cell_neg_42	I ` ve ever seen .
1_cell_neg_44	negative	True	1_cell_neg_43	Even after playing around with various settings
1_cell_neg_45	negative	False	1_cell_neg_44	it is still hard to quickly set the volume at the desired level .
1_cell_neg_46	negative	False	1_cell_neg_45	Even worse ,
1_cell_neg_47	negative	False	1_cell_neg_46	when using the phone your ear or finger can inadvertently hit the control
1_cell_neg_48	negative	False	1_cell_neg_47	and randomly change the volume .
1_cell_neg_49	negative	False	1_cell_neg_48	- The TI OMAP 850 at 201MHz is not beefy enough for the software
1_cell_neg_50	negative	False	1_cell_neg_49	that is loaded onto the device .
1_cell_neg_51	negative	False	1_cell_neg_50	However ,
1_cell_neg_52	negative	False	1_cell_neg_51	the blame could well be laid at Microsoft 's door for writing inefficient code
1_cell_neg_53	negative	False	1_cell_neg_52	and having poor scheduling software between tasks and applications .
1_cell_neg_54	negative	False	1_cell_neg_53	Either way , performance is very slow for some basic functions
1_cell_neg_55	negative	False	1_cell_neg_54	-LRB- see below -RRB-
1_cell_neg_56	negative	False	1_cell_neg_55	and
1_cell_neg_57	negative	False	1_cell_neg_56	I 'm afraid
1_cell_neg_58	negative	False	1_cell_neg_57	some of the blame needs to be laid at the choice of processor .
1_cell_neg_59	positive	False	1_cell_neg_58	Software Pro 's
1_cell_neg_60	negative	False	1_cell_neg_59	- Not many
1_cell_neg_61	negative	False	1_cell_neg_60	that really come to mind .
1_cell_neg_62	negative	False	1_cell_neg_61	Software Con 's
1_cell_neg_63	negative	False	1_cell_neg_62	-LRB- I hope
1_cell_neg_64	negative	False	1_cell_neg_63	you ` re sitting comfortably -RRB-
1_cell_neg_65	negative	False	1_cell_neg_64	-
1_cell_neg_66	negative	False	1_cell_neg_65	When a call is on call
1_cell_neg_67	negative	False	1_cell_neg_66	waiting the phone fails to give an option to the user to select which call to take and
1_cell_neg_68	negative	False	1_cell_neg_67	which call to put on hold or drop\/ignore .
1_cell_neg_69	negative	False	1_cell_neg_68	On the occasions
1_cell_neg_70	negative	False	1_cell_neg_69	this problem has occurred with me the call
1_cell_neg_71	negative	False	1_cell_neg_70	that is dropped\/kept appears random with a preference to switch to the incoming call no matter
1_cell_neg_72	negative	False	1_cell_neg_71	what is depressed .
1_cell_neg_73	negative	False	1_cell_neg_72	The other call is dropped and not put on hold .
1_cell_neg_74	negative	False	1_cell_neg_73	-
1_cell_neg_75	negative	False	1_cell_neg_74	When a call is incoming
1_cell_neg_76	negative	False	1_cell_neg_75	and the keyboard is locked ,
1_cell_neg_77	negative	False	1_cell_neg_76	if the user depresses the green phone key the call is dropped .
1_cell_neg_78	negative	False	1_cell_neg_77	This is extremely counter intuitive .
1_cell_neg_79	negative	False	1_cell_neg_78	"If the user presses anything other than the "" answer "" key the call is dropped and sometimes the call has been dropped even"
1_cell_neg_80	negative	False	1_cell_neg_79	"when I have depressed the "" answer "" key ."
1_cell_neg_81	negative	False	1_cell_neg_80	- The contacts database is extremely rudimentary with a very limited number of views and filters
1_cell_neg_82	negative	False	1_cell_neg_81	that can be used .
1_cell_neg_83	negative	False	1_cell_neg_82	Even worse , upon selection , the contacts database takes between 5 and 8 seconds
1_cell_neg_84	negative	False	1_cell_neg_83	to open .
1_cell_neg_85	negative	False	1_cell_neg_84	Now ,
1_cell_neg_86	negative	True	1_cell_neg_85	I have what some would call a large database of contacts ,
1_cell_neg_87	negative	False	1_cell_neg_86	but considering
1_cell_neg_88	negative	False	1_cell_neg_87	that the Palm OS version responded immediately with a far more sophisticated use model this excuse does not wash .
1_cell_neg_89	negative	False	1_cell_neg_88	It 's simply a poorly architected database .
1_cell_neg_90	negative	False	1_cell_neg_89	- The user interface for entering a new contact is rudimentary
1_cell_neg_91	negative	False	1_cell_neg_90	-LRB- as are all dialog windows on this device . -RRB-
1_cell_neg_92	negative	False	1_cell_neg_91	- One of the most annoying aspects of this device is the alarm clock .
1_cell_neg_93	negative	False	1_cell_neg_92	The user interface looks like it was written in 10 minutes
1_cell_neg_94	negative	False	1_cell_neg_93	and was clearly not verified for correctness .
1_cell_neg_95	negative	False	1_cell_neg_94	The digital watch I had in 1982 had the same degree of sophistication
1_cell_neg_96	negative	False	1_cell_neg_95	but with a more intuitive use model
1_cell_neg_97	negative	False	1_cell_neg_96	and was more thoroughly debugged .
1_cell_neg_98	negative	False	1_cell_neg_97	First of all , the user only gets to select a time and if the alarm is on or off .
1_cell_neg_99	negative	False	1_cell_neg_98	From the interface
1_cell_neg_100	negative	False	1_cell_neg_99	you would assume you could only set a single alarm . . .
1_cell_neg_101	negative	False	1_cell_neg_100	if only it were that obvious .
1_cell_neg_102	negative	False	1_cell_neg_101	The best way to explain this buggy piece of software is with an example :
1_cell_neg_103	negative	False	1_cell_neg_102	I set the alarm for 6am ;
1_cell_neg_104	negative	False	1_cell_neg_103	the next day the alarm goes off at 6am .
1_cell_neg_105	negative	False	1_cell_neg_104	That day I set the alarm for 7am -
1_cell_neg_106	negative	False	1_cell_neg_105	the following day the alarm goes off at 6am and 7am .
1_cell_neg_107	negative	False	1_cell_neg_106	The next day I set the alarm for 7:30 am and you guessed it ,
1_cell_neg_108	negative	False	1_cell_neg_107	the alarm now goes off three times .
1_cell_neg_109	negative	False	1_cell_neg_108	The best that I ` ve been able to deduce
1_cell_neg_110	negative	False	1_cell_neg_109	-LRB- of course , this type of behavior
1_cell_neg_111	negative	False	1_cell_neg_110	is not documented in the user manual
1_cell_neg_112	negative	False	1_cell_neg_111	that comes with the device -RRB-
1_cell_neg_113	negative	False	1_cell_neg_112	"is that the user has to actively select "" off "" for the current setting"
1_cell_neg_114	negative	False	1_cell_neg_113	"before setting "" on "" for the new time ."
1_cell_neg_115	negative	False	1_cell_neg_114	But there is no indication of what alarms are set , so after a while or a particularly busy week you can loose track of what 's set and what is n't . . . the only way to clear all of the alarms
1_cell_neg_116	negative	False	1_cell_neg_115	that have been set is a hard re-boot .
1_cell_neg_117	negative	False	1_cell_neg_116	- The calculator is a joke .
1_cell_neg_118	negative	False	1_cell_neg_117	If this took an engineer 10 minutes to write they should be fired .
1_cell_neg_119	positive	False	1_cell_neg_118	A calculator watch in the ' 80 's had more sophisticated features .
1_cell_neg_120	negative	False	1_cell_neg_119	The user interface is so bad
1_cell_neg_121	negative	False	1_cell_neg_120	it 's hard to describe it in words .
1_cell_neg_122	negative	False	1_cell_neg_121	- Microsoft truly does not understand
1_cell_neg_123	negative	False	1_cell_neg_122	how a user would like to use the device
1_cell_neg_124	negative	False	1_cell_neg_123	and instead insists on using the same usage model
1_cell_neg_125	negative	False	1_cell_neg_124	that they ` ve inflicted upon us since Windows 95 .
1_cell_neg_126	negative	False	1_cell_neg_125	Most features or function have to be navigated through the Start menu button .
1_cell_neg_127	negative	False	1_cell_neg_126	Applications are nested and features are hidden behind several annoying menu selections .
1_cell_neg_128	negative	True	1_cell_neg_127	Some features are simply hard to find ,
1_cell_neg_129	negative	False	1_cell_neg_128	but should it really take so many menu selections
1_cell_neg_130	negative	False	1_cell_neg_129	to find common tools or applications ?
1_cell_neg_131	negative	False	1_cell_neg_130	- The use of alarms or reminders is ambiguous -
1_cell_neg_132	negative	False	1_cell_neg_131	"to put the device in "" Silent "" mode ,"
1_cell_neg_133	negative	False	1_cell_neg_132	but leave alarms on
1_cell_neg_134	negative	False	1_cell_neg_133	because you want to sleep and only want your alarm to wake
1_cell_neg_135	negative	False	1_cell_neg_134	you
1_cell_neg_136	negative	False	1_cell_neg_135	up , for example ,
1_cell_neg_137	negative	False	1_cell_neg_136	does not work .
1_cell_neg_138	negative	False	1_cell_neg_137	Calendar reminders will be active
1_cell_neg_139	negative	False	1_cell_neg_138	as they are assigned the alarm property instead of their own or the notification property .
1_cell_neg_140	negative	False	1_cell_neg_139	The only way around this is to cancel reminders for all day events . . .
1_cell_neg_141	negative	False	1_cell_neg_140	otherwise
1_cell_neg_142	negative	False	1_cell_neg_141	you get an alarm at midnight .
1_cell_neg_143	positive	False	1_cell_neg_142	- So ,
1_cell_neg_144	positive	False	1_cell_neg_143	on my Nokia phone a thousand years ago ,
1_cell_neg_145	positive	False	1_cell_neg_144	when I went to Europe my phone would have a simple selection for the new frequency
1_cell_neg_146	positive	False	1_cell_neg_145	I needed

1_cell_neg_148	positive	False	1_cell_neg_147	The phone would then automatically connect to the provider available .
1_cell_neg_149	negative	True	1_cell_neg_148	It was n't completely automatic ,
1_cell_neg_150	positive	False	1_cell_neg_149	but the user interaction was simple and intuitive .
1_cell_neg_151	negative	False	1_cell_neg_150	Not with the Dash .
1_cell_neg_152	negative	False	1_cell_neg_151	First of all T-Mobile does n't help by keeping a radio button on your online account that you have to select to enable international roaming .
1_cell_neg_153	negative	False	1_cell_neg_152	The feature is free
1_cell_neg_154	negative	False	1_cell_neg_153	so why not add a selection anyway ?
1_cell_neg_155	negative	False	1_cell_neg_154	All you know
1_cell_neg_156	negative	False	1_cell_neg_155	when you get to your destination is that your phone wo n't connect to the local network no matter
1_cell_neg_157	negative	False	1_cell_neg_156	what you do .
1_cell_neg_158	negative	False	1_cell_neg_157	Now ,
1_cell_neg_159	negative	False	1_cell_neg_158	assuming
1_cell_neg_160	negative	False	1_cell_neg_159	that you worked this out ,
1_cell_neg_161	negative	False	1_cell_neg_160	you are now faced with the challenge of actually connecting to the local provider 's network .
1_cell_neg_162	positive	True	1_cell_neg_161	On my Blackberry this was automatic ,
1_cell_neg_163	negative	False	1_cell_neg_162	but of course with Microsoft
1_cell_neg_164	negative	False	1_cell_neg_163	there are selections to make , searches to activate and various other contortions
1_cell_neg_165	negative	False	1_cell_neg_164	that need to be gone through before you connect to the provider of choice .
1_cell_neg_166	negative	False	1_cell_neg_165	Assuming that you get

1_cell_neg_168	negative	False	1_cell_neg_167	- ActiveSync :
1_cell_neg_169	negative	False	1_cell_neg_168	This is the most annoying piece of software in that it just does not work .
1_cell_neg_170	negative	False	1_cell_neg_169	Worse still ,
1_cell_neg_171	negative	False	1_cell_neg_170	when it does not work it gives a cryptic error message
1_cell_neg_172	negative	False	1_cell_neg_171	stating that an error has occurred and some data will be lost next time you perform synchronization .
1_cell_neg_173	negative	False	1_cell_neg_172	It does not provide you with a fix , a hint or a path so that you do n't lose data .
1_cell_neg_174	negative	False	1_cell_neg_173	It does not even tell you the data
1_cell_neg_175	negative	False	1_cell_neg_174	that was lost .
1_cell_neg_176	positive	False	1_cell_neg_175	So ,

1_cell_neg_193	negative	False	1_cell_neg_192	And they are major .
1_cell_neg_194	negative	False	1_cell_neg_193	Considering this is Windows Mobile 5.0 what on earth were they
