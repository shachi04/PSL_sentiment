10_kitchen_neg_1	I am
10_kitchen_neg_2	looking for a remote trainer for one of my dogs .
10_kitchen_neg_3	Amazon 's listing says
10_kitchen_neg_4	"this Innotek trainer comes with a "" lifetime warranty . """
10_kitchen_neg_5	I ` ve read
10_kitchen_neg_6	that batteries can be an issue with remote training collars , so I decided to review the owner 's manual
10_kitchen_neg_7	to learn more about the warranty .
10_kitchen_neg_8	-LRB- . . . -RRB-
10_kitchen_neg_9	The last page has a section
10_kitchen_neg_10	"entitled "" Lifetime Limited Warranty , """
10_kitchen_neg_11	"which states "" . . . INNOTEK brand products will be free from defects in material and workmanship , under normal use , for a period of one year from the date of the original retail purchase . """
10_kitchen_neg_12	"The "" lifetime warranty """
10_kitchen_neg_13	apparently expires after one year !
10_kitchen_neg_14	Further on it says ,
10_kitchen_neg_15	"the company "" offers several product exchange options during the warranty period . . ."
10_kitchen_neg_16	"Costs are dependent on the processing time . """
10_kitchen_neg_17	"This suggests customers will incur fees for warranty repairs even during the one year "" lifetime "" warranty ."
10_kitchen_neg_18	The next paragraph says
10_kitchen_neg_19	After one year from date of original retail purchase ,
10_kitchen_neg_20	we will repair , replace or upgrade your product at a fixed rate
10_kitchen_neg_21	"based on the component . """
10_kitchen_neg_22	What will these repairs cost ?
10_kitchen_neg_23	This leaves me with a big question mark about buying a collar from Innotek .
10_kitchen_neg_24	What , if anything ,
10_kitchen_neg_25	"is warranted for a "" lifetime ? """
10_kitchen_neg_26	If the lifetime warranty is really only for one year ,
10_kitchen_neg_27	"why call it "" lifetime ? """
10_kitchen_neg_28	"And finally , what will repairs cost , both during warranty under their "" product exchange options """
10_kitchen_neg_29	"and afterwards under their component-based "" fixed rate ? """
10_kitchen_neg_30	My specific concern is that the collar contains a rechargeable battery .
10_kitchen_neg_31	The manual does not indicate that this battery is user-replaceable .
10_kitchen_neg_32	Does this mean the user will have to send the collar to Innotek to replace the battery and , if so ,
10_kitchen_neg_33	what will it cost ?
10_kitchen_neg_34	I have contacted Innotek through their website
10_kitchen_neg_35	and will report back if I get a response .
10_kitchen_neg_36	Until I do ,
10_kitchen_neg_37	I ` ve got to rate this product with only one star
10_kitchen_neg_38	because of the warranty .
10_kitchen_neg_39	Can anyone comment on warranty claims to Innotek
