12_cell_neg_1	I ordered a Motorola RAZR V3 Mauve Phone -LRB- Unlocked -RRB-
12_cell_neg_2	a month ago .
12_cell_neg_3	I was hoping
12_cell_neg_4	to get the color
12_cell_neg_5	that I saw on the web page . . . and
12_cell_neg_6	that 's
12_cell_neg_7	where the problem lies .
12_cell_neg_8	The image shown is completely misleading .
12_cell_neg_9	The phone that I received , was mauve
12_cell_neg_10	but a different one from the picture
12_cell_neg_11	shown on the Amazon web site .
12_cell_neg_12	The mauve phone that I got was a grayish dull mauve and not the pretty pinkish mauve as advertised .
12_cell_neg_13	Also , the phone had 2 different color tones .
12_cell_neg_14	At night\/in the lighting at night , the top part of the phone -LRB- the part that flips open -RRB-
12_cell_neg_15	and its corresponding part at the back of the phone looks completely gray .
12_cell_neg_16	Needless to say ,
12_cell_neg_17	I spoke to customer service
12_cell_neg_18	and sent the phone back for an exchange .
12_cell_neg_19	I did n't have to pay the shipping charges .
12_cell_neg_20	The 2nd phone
12_cell_neg_21	that came had the same color problem again , so for the 2nd time I returned it
12_cell_neg_22	and got my money refunded .
12_cell_neg_23	I gave 1 star due to the customer service
12_cell_neg_24	provided ,
12_cell_neg_25	but again they could not help me .
12_cell_neg_26	Some one said
12_cell_neg_27	it could be an item with a defect . . . but for me
12_cell_neg_28	the whole experience was disappointing .
12_cell_neg_29	If you are ready to spend so much on this phone its because of the brand , and the ' color '
12_cell_neg_30	which you will never get
12_cell_neg_31	because Amazon has put the wrong image on the web page . . . very misleading and wrong to all the customers .
12_cell_neg_32	Incidentally , this color as seen is offered by Verizon
12_cell_neg_33	and they call
12_cell_neg_34	it ' pink ' ,
12_cell_neg_35	but Amazon calls it ' mauve ' ,
12_cell_neg_36	though the phone and the image
12_cell_neg_37	shown do not match .
12_cell_neg_38	So stay away from ordering this pretty mauve phone . . . all
12_cell_neg_39	you will get is loads of disappointment with your time being wasted .
