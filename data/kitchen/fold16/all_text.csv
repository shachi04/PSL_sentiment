16_kitchen_pos_1	I bought one of these from a yard sale for use at my small office .
16_kitchen_pos_2	I was getting stuck cleaning up the kitchen
16_kitchen_pos_3	and decided to see if this little unit was worth it .
16_kitchen_pos_4	I 'd
16_kitchen_pos_5	looked at the small Haier unit
16_kitchen_pos_6	and was not impressed with the plastic interior .
16_kitchen_pos_7	I broke a lot of rules
16_kitchen_pos_8	setting this up .
16_kitchen_pos_9	Its not connected to the hot water supply ,
16_kitchen_pos_10	since I have a very old sink and the only other connection
16_kitchen_pos_11	I had was to cold water lines .
16_kitchen_pos_12	Also , the machine is on the floor ,
16_kitchen_pos_13	under the sink .
16_kitchen_pos_14	I bought new hoses
16_kitchen_pos_15	to make the connections .
16_kitchen_pos_16	Luckily ,
16_kitchen_pos_17	the standard connectors on the back made this easy - the fill is a standard clothes washer fill line ,
16_kitchen_pos_18	and the drain can take a piece of garden hose .
16_kitchen_pos_19	I was concerned with the garden hose holding up to very hot wash drain water ,
16_kitchen_pos_20	but so far its been okay .
16_kitchen_pos_21	-LRB- If I was installing this anyplace else or using this in my home ,
16_kitchen_pos_22	I might not be so nonchalant . -RRB-
16_kitchen_pos_23	My unit was used , from an area
16_kitchen_pos_24	where there was very hard water ,
16_kitchen_pos_25	and the previous owners had never cleaned the innards of the machine .
16_kitchen_pos_26	I soaked everything in CLR to remove the scale from the sump grill , the heating element and the wash arm ,
16_kitchen_pos_27	and cleaned the gunk out from under the door seal ,
16_kitchen_pos_28	and away we went .
16_kitchen_pos_29	Since we are in an office ,
16_kitchen_pos_30	we always use the Sanitary wash to keep the cooties down .
16_kitchen_pos_31	The machine does an excellent job of getting even cold tapwater super hot ,
16_kitchen_pos_32	and the dishes will flash dry
16_kitchen_pos_33	after the cycle is over ,
16_kitchen_pos_34	if you pop the door open .
16_kitchen_pos_35	The machine has no problem pumping wastewater through the drain line
16_kitchen_pos_36	and up 3 feet into the sink .
16_kitchen_pos_37	One reason I avoided the plastic tub Haier is noise .
16_kitchen_pos_38	If you load this machine carefully ,
16_kitchen_pos_39	you can prevent items from clinking against each other too much ,
16_kitchen_pos_40	and the machine will operate more quietly .
16_kitchen_pos_41	We ` ve found
16_kitchen_pos_42	that we can run the machine , have the office radio on , and still comfortably make phone calls without much trouble .
16_kitchen_pos_43	My only complaints would be that on occasion ,
16_kitchen_pos_44	the timer has gotten stuck
16_kitchen_pos_45	-LRB- once or twice in 100 washes -RRB- .
16_kitchen_pos_46	Also , some plastic items have been slightly warped by the heater .
16_kitchen_pos_47	Capacity is very decent , probably
16_kitchen_pos_48	because the machine is pretty large .
16_kitchen_pos_49	Measure first
