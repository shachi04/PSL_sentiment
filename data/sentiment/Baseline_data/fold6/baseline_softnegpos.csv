negative	0.125	0.21875	Here  are  the  main  issues  I  have  found  with  this  phone  : 
negative	0.25	0.1875	1  -RRB-  The  buttons  are  too  small  , 
negative	0.0001	0.25	particularly  the  main  control  button  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	You  have  to  used  the  side  of  your  fingers 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  ensure 
negative	0.4375	0.125	that  you  do  not  hit  too  buttons  at  the  same  time  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	And  ,  believe 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	me  , 
negative	0.3333333333333333	0.25	I  do  not  have  very  large  hands  . 
negative	0.625	0.3125	2  -RRB-  If  you  have  quite  a  few  contacts  in  your  phone  , 
negative	0.125	0.25	you  will  be  irritated  by  the  delay 
negative	0.0001	0.375	when  you  scroll  down  quickly  to  select  a  contact  . 
negative	0.375	0.375	You  will  notice  that  if  you  are  not  careful  , 
negative	0.75	0.25	you  will  dial  the  wrong  contact  due 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  the  delay 
negative	0.125	0.3333333333333333	when  scrolling  and  selecting  quickly  ,  so  if  this  is  you  ,  be  aware  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	3  -RRB-  You 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	must  open  the  cover 
negative	0.25	0.25	and  look  inside  to  see  if  you  have  missed  a  call  or  have  a  message  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	VERY  INCONVENIENT  !  ! 
negative	0.125	0.25	There  is  no  indication  to  show  this  on  the  top  screen  ,  only  the  inside  screen  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	4  -RRB-  On  occasion  ,  the  display  on  the  outside  of  the  phone  stops 
negative	0.0001	0.5	working  entirely  . 
negative	0.1875	0.25	What  you  just  need  to  do  is  power  the  phone  down 
negative	0.0001	0.375	and  they  back  up  again  . 
negative	0.625	0.0001	Not  optimal  , 
negative	0.625	0.125	and  I  probably  just  got  a  bad  phone  , 
negative	0.125	0.1875	but  I  am  just  waiting  for  the  situation  to  get  more  frequent  , 
negative	0.25	0.25	so  I  can  then  deal  with  the  likely  nightmare  of  having  to  get  a  replacement  phone  from  Motorola  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	NOTE  : 
negative	0.0001	0.25	I  have  no  personal  vendetta  against  Motorola  , 
negative	0.5	0.375	but  wanted  to  provide  some  real  feedback  rather  than  all  just  rosey  stuff 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  bought  into  before  purchasing 
negative	0.0001	0.125	Well  I  read  through  just  about  every  review  prior  to  purchasing  this  phone 
negative	0.125	0.25	and  was  almost  thinking  twice  about  it 
negative	0.0001	0.125	after  reading  some  of  the  reviews  here  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	but  I  decided  to  take  the  plunge 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  go  for  it  . 
positive	0.625	0.125	Well  I  'm  glad 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  did  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	All  I  can  say  is  this  phone 
positive	0.125	0.25	has  been  a  pleasure 
positive	0.0001	0.125	to  use  from  the  get-go  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	It  has  its  flaws 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	but  what  phone  does  n't  ? 
positive	0.1875	0.225	The  question  is  whether  you  `  re  going  go  flip  out  over  an  alarm  clock  or  volume  strip  or  is  it  a  trivial  issue  for  you  . 
positive	0.5	0.25	Most  of  the  gripes  others  have  had  just  seem  little  to  me  . 
positive	0.125	0.0001	Let  's  talk  about  the  pros  and  cons  : 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Pros  : 
positive	0.125	0.3125	1  .  Call  quality  is  excellent  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	No  static 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	what  so  ever  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	No  dropped  calls  . 
positive	0.0001	0.5	My  area  has  good  T-mobile  coverage 
positive	0.75	0.0001	so  I  ca  n't  complain  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	As  a  phone 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	it  does 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	what  it  's  supposed  to  do  . 
positive	0.0001	0.4375	Make  good  quality  calls  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	It  also  pairs  with  my  bluetooth  headset 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB-  Plantronics  510  -RRB- 
positive	0.0001	0.5	really  well  . 
positive	0.1875	0.375	Speaker  phone  is  of  good  quality  too  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	2  .  Internet  works  great  . 
positive	0.0001	0.25	I  have  the  $  5.99  plan 
negative	0.125	0.25	and  yes  EDGE  is  n't  the  fastest 
positive	0.0001	0.125	but  it  gets  the  job 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	done  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	It  does  n't  matter 
positive	0.0001	0.5	where  I  'm  at  I  can  check  my  email  , 
positive	0.0001	0.4375	finds  restaurants  or  directions  ,  or  just  surf  the  web 
positive	0.0001	0.125	when  I  'm  bored  . 
positive	0.0001	0.625	It  really  came  in  handy 
positive	0.125	0.25	when  I  was  out  on  vacation 
positive	0.5	0.0001	and  lost  . 
positive	0.25	0.25	WiFi  works  well  too  . 
positive	0.0001	0.25	Did  n't  want  to  fork  out  the  money  for  hotspots  though  . 
positive	0.125	0.4166666666666667	3  .  The  camera  at  1.3  megapixels  is  decent  quality  . 
negative	0.5625	0.0001	No  it  's  not  going  to  replace  my  regular  camera 
positive	0.0001	0.625	but  I  found  it  really  handy 
positive	0.0001	0.1875	when  I  forgot  to  take  my  camera  to  my  friend  's  wedding  , 
positive	0.125	0.25	but  was  still  able  to  take  quality  pictures  . 
positive	0.0001	0.25	I  have  n't  tried  videos  yet  though  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	4  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Mp3\/Video  player  : 
negative	0.125	0.25	Now  the  speakers  on  this  phone  are  n't  the  greatest  so  I  would  n't  use  them  for  listening  to  music 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	but  when  plugged  into  a  headset 
positive	0.25	0.4375	it  sounds  pretty  good  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  bought 
positive	0.0001	0.125	a  2GB  microSD  card  bought  here  at  Amazon 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  now  I  can  hold  a  ton  music  and  movies  . 
positive	0.25	0.5	Videos  looks  pretty  nice 
positive	0.0001	0.1875	I  'd  have  to  admit  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	This  thing  is  my  travelinig  entertainment  center  . 
positive	0.0001	0.1875	I  even  found  a  way  to  play  original  nintendo  games  on  this  thing 
positive	0.125	0.2916666666666667	and  have  been  trying  Mike  Tyson  's  Punchout  like  back  in  the  old  days  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	5  .  Calendar\/schedule  : 
positive	0.0001	0.25	I  had  a  PDA 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	but  for  some  reason 
positive	0.0001	0.375	I  'm  more  compelled  to  actually  use  my  calendar 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  keep  my  schedule  on  this  thing 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	than  I  did  with  my  Pocket  PC  . 
positive	0.0001	0.375	Probably  because  of  convenience  reasons  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	6  .  Smartphone  applications  : 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  'm  in  the  medical  field 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  I  keep  all  my  medical  applications  on  this  phone  . 
positive	0.25	0.375	I  can  quickly  look  up  drug  references  or  research  diseases  . 
positive	0.25	0.4375	I  really  thought  I  'd  need  a  touchscreen 
positive	0.0001	0.875	in  order  to  better  navigate  these  programs 
positive	0.1875	0.4375	and  while  it  might  be  slightly  easier  with  a  stylus  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  do  n't  find  that  it  's  all  that 
positive	0.0001	0.625	necessary 
positive	0.125	0.375	and  still  navigate  pretty  well  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	I  just  wish  the  processor  were  slightly  faster  for  some  of  these  apps  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	but  it  's  more  than  adequate  . 
positive	0.5625	0.25	And  I  'm  not  sure 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	why  people  do  n't  think 
positive	0.125	0.25	there  are  a  lot  of  programs  for  the  smartphone  . 
positive	0.125	0.3125	Programs  written  for  WM5  are  compatable  with  PPC  as  well  as  smartphones  equally  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB-  .  .  .  -RRB-  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	7  .  Appearance  : 
positive	0.0001	0.5	Everyone  who  sees  this  phone  absolutely  loves  its  looks 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  so  do  I  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	It  looks  great 
positive	0.0001	0.125	and  feels  great  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  saw  this  side  by  side  with  the  Motorola  Q 
positive	0.625	0.25	and  the  Q  just  looked  so  much  bulkier  and  .  .  .  well  .  .  .  not 
positive	0.0001	0.875	as  nice  . 
positive	0.25	0.125	The  rubber  backing  feels  awesome  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	8  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Battery  : 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	For  all 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	that  I  use  this  phone 
positive	0.5	0.0001	for  it  makes  it  through  the  day  with  plenty  battery  to  spare 
positive	0.125	0.25	which  is  all 
positive	0.0001	0.625	I  can  really  ask  for  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  would  n't  go  2  days  without  charging  the  battery  though  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	You  should  charge  it  every  night  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Cons  : 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	1  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Windows  Mobile  5  : 
negative	0.3125	0.375	Mighty  Microsoft  needs  to  write  a  cleaner  program  . 
negative	0.3125	0.1875	However  Windows  Mobile  6  is  on  the  way 
negative	0.125	0.3125	and  will  be  free  to  download  for  T-Mobile  customer  soon 
negative	0.625	0.5	so  hopefully  that  `  ll  take  care  of  some  of  the  problems  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  swear  just  to  turn  on  the  bluetooth 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  pair  up  my  bluetooth  device 
negative	0.4375	0.1875	takes  me  a  whole  minute  just  because  of  how  hard  it  is  to  navigate  WM5  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	2  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Volume  strip  : 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Yeah  like  everyone  says 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	it  sucks  . 
negative	0.375	0.0001	I  disabled  mine  . 
negative	0.125	0.375	Adjusting  the  volume  with  this  thing  is  tedious  at  best  . 
positive	0.0001	0.4375	Luckily  my  music\/video  programs  as  well  as  my  stereo  headset  allow 
positive	0.25	0.375	me  easier  ways  to  adjust  the  volume 
positive	0.625	0.125	so  it  's  not  such  an  issue  for  me  . 
negative	0.25	0.375	3  .  Alarm  clock  : 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Now  I  do  n't  use  this  all  that  much 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	but  I  see  what  everyone  says 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	about  it 
negative	0.25	0.125	and  yeah  it  's  a  pretty  idiotic  written  program  . 
positive	0.4375	0.3125	However  rather  than  writing  half  a  page  on  how  bad  it  is  I  downloaded  a  free  one  from  the  internet 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	that  works  great 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	so  my  life  now  goes  on  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Summary  : 
positive	0.0001	0.2916666666666667	So  I  use  this  device  to  make  quality  phone  calls  ,  surf  the  web  ,  check  email  ,  play  games  ,  listen  to  music  ,  watch  movies  ,  monitor  my  schedule  ,  check  my  medical  references  , 
positive	0.0001	0.375	and  take  decent  quality  pictures  . 
positive	0.25	0.25	All  this  thing  needs 
positive	0.1875	0.25	now  is  a  laser  beam 
positive	0.0001	0.125	that  will  cut  through  metal 
positive	0.125	0.25	and  it  'd  be  the  greatest  gadget 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	known  to  man 
positive	0.0001	0.125	I  normally  do  n't  write  reviews  .  .  . 
positive	0.25	0.625	but  after  owning  several  toasters  in  the  past  , 
positive	0.20833333333333331	0.25	and  being  very  disappointed  , 
positive	0.0001	0.25	I  just  had  to  write  about  this  one  . 
positive	0.0001	0.5	I  owned  an  old  Toastmaster  4  slice  toaster  for  about  20  years  . 
positive	0.375	0.25	It  never  did  brown  evenly  ,  but  was  a  workhorse 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	until  finally  the  bread  crumb  tray  broke  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Got  my  money  's  worth  . 
positive	0.0001	0.3333333333333333	I  have  done  a  lot  of  research  on  toasters  on  epinions  ,  amazon  ,  and  others  .  .  . 
positive	0.1875	0.45	and  many  people  have  n't  been  very  happy  with  toasters 
positive	0.0001	0.25	they  have  bought 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	costing  nearly  $  300.00 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB-  dualit  -RRB-  . 
positive	0.34375	0.16666666666666666	Toastmaster  ,  GE  ,  Rival  ,  Dualit  ,  most  Kitchenaid  and  Sunbeam  models  were  poorly  rated  . 
positive	0.25	0.125	I  found  one  review  on  this  Sunbeam 
positive	0.25	0.25	-LRB-  this  is  their  top  of  the  line  model  ,  the  chrome  and  black  model  costs  more  , 
negative	0.625	0.0001	but  currently  not  in  production  .  -RRB- 
positive	0.0001	0.4583333333333333	and  the  person  really  really  liked  it  . 
positive	0.1875	0.1875	So  I  ordered  this  from  Amazon  directly  ,  this  was  the  VERY  lowest  price 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  could  find  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Order  something  else  so 
positive	0.0001	0.25	as  to  get  their  free  shipping 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB-  over  $  25.00  -RRB- 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	So  what  happened 
positive	0.0001	0.125	when  I  got  it  . 
positive	0.0001	0.625	Got  the  toaster  .  .  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	plugged  it  in  .  .  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	dropped  two  slices  of  bread  in  , 
positive	0.0001	0.125	and  excitedly 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	waited  for  my  toast  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	A  few  minutes  passed  .  .  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	then  .  .  POP  ! 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	its  done  .  .  .  or  so  I  thought  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	When  the  toast  came  out  .  .  . 
negative	0.5	0.25	it  was  brown  only  on  one  side  the  other  side  poorly  toasted  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	This  goes  for  BOTH  slices  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	Right  then  and  there  I  was  ready  to  send  this  thing  back  . 
positive	0.125	0.2916666666666667	Well  .  .  .  had  been  busy  that  week 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  continued  using  it  day 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	after  day  .  .  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	Each  day  was  as  disappointing  as  the  first  .  .  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	THEN  .  .  . 
positive	0.375	0.0001	after  a  little  over  a  week  .  .  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	The  bread  started  toasting  .  .  .  uh  .  . 
positive	0.0001	0.4375	well  PERFECTLY  !  !  ! 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	After  owning  this  for  nearly  4  months  .  .  . 
positive	0.1875	0.0001	it  still  browns  evenly  on  BOTH  sides  of  each  piece  of  bread  ,  crisp  on  the  outside  ,  soft  on  the  inside  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  do  n't  know 
negative	0.0001	0.25	why  it  started  working  right  .  .  .  would  n't  think 
negative	0.16666666666666666	0.25	"that  it  would  need  to  be  ""  broken  in  "" "
negative	0.0001	0.25	to  work  right  . 
positive	0.375	0.1875	I  am  so  glad 
positive	0.0001	0.25	that  I  did  n't  send  this  back  right  after  the  first  several  toastings  .  .  . 
positive	0.0001	0.75	Procrastinating  worked  out  in  my  best  interest  ,  for  the  first  time  . 
positive	0.625	0.25	I  have  not  tried  Bagels  in  this  .  .  . 
positive	0.0001	0.125	do  n't  like  bagels  .  .  . 
positive	0.0001	0.375	but  it  does  well  for  what  I  bought  it  for  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  think 
negative	0.3125	0.375	the  style  is  rather  funky  , 
positive	0.0001	0.1875	but  many  people  have  liked  its  looks  . 
positive	0.0001	0.6875	If  this  toaster  works  for  you  as  good 
positive	0.0001	0.25	as  it  has  for  me  .  .  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  think 
positive	0.0001	0.125	you  will  like  it  !  !  ! 
negative	0.0001	0.3125	If  it  does  n't  work  well  right  out  of  the  box  .  .  . 
positive	0.125	0.0001	you  might  give  it  a  few  days  .  .  . 
positive	0.25	0.125	maybe  the  toast  fairy  will  bless  you  too  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	When  I  ordered  this  product  , 
positive	0.0001	0.25	it  had  a  4  star  average  rating  - 
negative	0.125	0.25	how  that  happened  is  beyond  me  .

negative	0.75	0.5625	I  should  have  tried  harder  to  find  a  Pampered  Chef  rep  to  buy  another  one  ,  the  Pampered  Chef  one  works  better  than  this  one  . 
positive	0.5	0.125	However  , 
positive	0.375	0.25	this  is  not  a  horrible  product  . 
negative	0.125	0.3125	One  drawback  compared  to  the  Pampered  Chef  one  is  that  you  ca  n't  see  through  this  one  to  see 
negative	0.1875	0.1875	how  high  the  oil  level  is  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	You  want  to  fill  it  just  a  bit  higher  than  halfway  ,

negative	0.2916666666666667	0.25	when  it  is  less  than  1\/3  full  you  need 
negative	0.0001	0.375	to  fill  it  back  up  or  it  wo  n't  work  as  well  . 
negative	0.1875	0.1875	This  unit  is  even  more  finicky  than  the  Pampered  Chef  one  about  the  level  , 
negative	0.21875	0.1875	it  almost  wo  n't  spray  if  the  level  is  too  low  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	But  since  you  ca  n't  see  through  it  , 
negative	0.0001	0.125	even  holding  it  up  to  the  light  , 
negative	0.25	0.25	you  have  to  look  down  in  and  estimate 
negative	0.1875	0.1875	how  high  it  is  . 
negative	0.1875	0.25	The  reflective  coating  inside  makes  it  very  hard  to  see 
negative	0.1875	0.3333333333333333	how  high  it  really  is  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	You  do  n't  want  to  fill  it  all  the  way  up  ,  either  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Then  , 
positive	0.25	0.25	you  need 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  pump  it  more 
negative	0.1875	0.25	than  the  Pampered  Chef  one  needed  to  be  pumped  . 
positive	0.1875	0.25	This  one  sprays  a  very  fine  spray  ,  finer  than  the  Pampered  Chef  one  . 
positive	0.3333333333333333	0.25	And  it  sprays  quite  nicely  if  you  have  the  correct  level  of  oil  in  there  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  think 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  know 
positive	0.0001	0.375	why  my  old  one  got  clogged  . 
positive	0.0001	0.375	So  I  'm  trying  something  new  : 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	each  time  I  'm  done  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	before  I  put  it  away  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  twist  the  screw  on  cap  around  the  nozzle 
positive	0.0001	0.125	and  release  the  pressure  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  think 
positive	0.125	0.375	if  you  leave  it  pressured  up  all  the  time  , 
positive	0.0001	0.375	like  I  did  with  my  old  one  , 
positive	0.75	0.0001	it  damages  the  nozzle  over  time  . 
positive	0.0001	0.25	But  time  will  tell  if  I  'm  right  . 
negative	0.125	0.0001	Another  tip  --  do  n't  fill  it  with  anything  but  olive  oil  . 
negative	0.375	0.0001	Other  oils  evaporate 
negative	0.125	0.125	and  leave  a  sticky\/greasy  feeling  on  the  outside  of  the  sprayer  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	You  know 
positive	0.125	0.0001	what  I  mean  if  you  use  vegetable  oil  for  stovetop  cooking  a  lot  , 
positive	0.125	0.125	you  get  that  greasy  feeling  on  things  that  you  leave  near  the  stove  or  that  hang  over  it  . 
positive	0.125	0.0001	Olive  oil  does  n't  do  that  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	that  's  why  I  now  do  n't  use  anything  else  on  my  stovetop 
positive	0.375	0.0001	-LRB-  except  sometimes  peanut  oil  for  stir  frying  -RRB-  . 
positive	0.125	0.875	This  type  of  sprayer  will  work  much  better  if  you  just  use  Olive  Oil  in  it  ,  trust  me  . 
negative	0.0001	0.4375	But  if  you  have  a  choice  ,  go  find  a  Pampered  Chef  rep  and  by  their  sprayer  . 
negative	0.25	0.625	It  's  cheaper  and  better  quality 
positive	0.25	0.2916666666666667	I  `  ve  bought  a  number  of  Oxo  kitchen  accessories  ,  and  found  them  to  be  sturdy  ,  remarkably  well  designed  , 
positive	0.25	0.625	and  easy  to  use  . 
negative	0.5	0.25	Unfortunately  ,  this  timer  is  an  exception  . 
positive	0.0001	0.16666666666666666	It  has  the  usual  features  typical  of  timers  at  this  price  point  : 
positive	0.375	0.0001	clock  plus  timer  ,  ten  number  keys  for  input  ,  memory  ,  etc  . 
positive	0.1875	0.25	But  instead  of  being  flat  with  a  magnet  on  the  back 
positive	0.625	0.125	so  it  can  fall  off  the  refrigerator  like  other  timers  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	it  's  round  like  a  traditional  wind-up  kitchen  timer  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	It  's  solid-feeling 
positive	0.125	0.5625	and  has  nice  non-skid  feet  on  the  bottom  . 
negative	0.375	0.25	The  problem  is  the  display  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	It  's  horrible  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	For  three  reasons  : 
negative	0.375	0.25	First  ,  the  numbers  are  small  --  smaller  than  any  other  timer 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  `  ve  seen  . 
negative	0.25	0.125	"They  `  re  about  1\/4  ""  high  , "
negative	0.4375	0.3125	half  or  less  the  size  of  those  on  comparable  timers  . 
negative	0.375	0.375	"Second  ,  the  numbers  are  recessed  1\/8  ""  or  more  beneath  a  clear  plastic  cover  ,  not  on  the  surface "
negative	0.125	0.20833333333333331	--  it  's  dark  in  there  and  feels  like  looking  down  a  well  . 
negative	0.1875	0.1875	It  desperately  needs  a  backlight  , 
negative	0.125	0.25	but  there  is  none  . 
negative	0.1875	0.3125	Unless  the  light  source  is  shining  directly  into  the  display  , 
negative	0.3125	0.1875	there  's  a  large  dark  shadow 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	covering  part  of  the  numbers  . 
negative	0.625	0.0001	But  that  causes  the  third  problem  : 
negative	0.125	0.4375	The  clear  plastic  cover  over  the  numbers  is  both  curved  and  highly  reflective  , 
negative	0.3333333333333333	0.16666666666666666	and  it  's  virtually  impossible  to  arrange  things  so  that  there  is  n't  a  reflection 
negative	0.25	0.4375	shining  back  into  your  eyes  . 
negative	0.125	0.20833333333333331	The  bottom  line  is  that  I  have  to  fiddle  around  to  get  the  timer  ,  the  light  source  ,  and  myself  into  a  position 
negative	0.25	0.125	where  I  can  read  the  small  ,  dark  ,  shadowed  , 
negative	0.0001	0.375	and  reflective  display  . 
negative	0.4375	0.25	Not  what  I  need 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	when  I  'm  trying  to  cook  . 
negative	0.625	0.0001	It  's  just  not  worth  it  . 
negative	0.625	0.25	Since  I  have  several  other  timers  with  displays 
negative	0.25	0.25	I  do  n't  have  to  strain  to  read  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  use  this  one  as  a  paperweight  . 
positive	0.0001	0.25	I  'd  have  to  say 
positive	0.25	0.3125	it  works  very  well  . 
negative	0.0001	0.375	I  just  do  n't  understand
