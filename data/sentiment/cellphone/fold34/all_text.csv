14_cell_neg_1	The phone is great . .
14_cell_neg_2	and I knew
14_cell_neg_3	it would be .
14_cell_neg_4	And I am a devoted Amazon shopper .
14_cell_neg_5	My concern was always whether Amazon was up to the daunting task of selling cell phones and service plans . . .
14_cell_neg_6	a concern
14_cell_neg_7	that has proved well founded .
14_cell_neg_8	I was originally concerned
14_cell_neg_9	because of feedback
14_cell_neg_10	I had read on this site
14_cell_neg_11	"indicating the Pearl "" shipped hot , "" with an active SIM ,"
14_cell_neg_12	which meant for those
14_cell_neg_13	that -- like me - were upgrading
14_cell_neg_14	-LRB- vs . new service -RRB- ,
14_cell_neg_15	their existing phone would stop working
14_cell_neg_16	while the new phone was en route .
14_cell_neg_17	To be fair ,
14_cell_neg_18	that did NOT happen ; however ,
14_cell_neg_19	I received the Pearl with a SIM card that the phone would not accept .
14_cell_neg_20	The instructions
14_cell_neg_21	that are sent with the phone say
14_cell_neg_22	that all you have to do is insert the SIM , turn on the phone ,
14_cell_neg_23	and it will work .
14_cell_neg_24	And ,
14_cell_neg_25	if it does n't work ,
14_cell_neg_26	it says ,
14_cell_neg_27	do n't call Cingular , call Amazon .
14_cell_neg_28	I followed the instructions
14_cell_neg_29	-- phone did n't work ,
14_cell_neg_30	I called Amazon ,
14_cell_neg_31	at which point the CSR told me
14_cell_neg_32	that he had all my information and someone would be contacting me in 48 HOURS ! ! !
14_cell_neg_33	Unfortunately ,
14_cell_neg_34	I let the poor guy have it . . .
14_cell_neg_35	I told him what I truly believe ,
14_cell_neg_36	which is that it is COMPLETELY unacceptable to tell me
14_cell_neg_37	I have to wait 2 days just to talk to someone about
14_cell_neg_38	why my phone -
14_cell_neg_39	which is supposed to work out of the box -- is n't working .
14_cell_neg_40	So - 5 Stars for the phone
14_cell_neg_41	itself . . .
14_cell_neg_42	awesome !
14_cell_neg_43	2 stars for Amazon . . .
14_cell_neg_44	they do NOT have the kinks
14_cell_neg_45	worked out yet .
14_cell_neg_46	On a positive note --
14_cell_neg_47	I immediately called Cingular ,
14_cell_neg_48	and they resolved the problem for me on the spot
14_cell_neg_49	-LRB- SIM was not activated \/ in the system -RRB-
