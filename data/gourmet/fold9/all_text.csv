9_gourmet_pos_1	My kid was upset
9_gourmet_pos_2	when I got him an improvised Harry Potter broom for Christmas -- O. K . ,
9_gourmet_pos_3	it was n't an officially licensed product ,
9_gourmet_pos_4	but since magic brooms are imaginary anyway , any stick with a bunch of straw at one end is as good as any other .
9_gourmet_pos_5	But no -- apparently a Corn Lobby Broom was n't good enough for him .
9_gourmet_pos_6	Anyway , he would n't talk to me for a month ,
9_gourmet_pos_7	which was good at first ,
9_gourmet_pos_8	but then got really annoying .
9_gourmet_pos_9	For my kid 's birthday
9_gourmet_pos_10	I decided to get
9_gourmet_pos_11	him something really special ,
9_gourmet_pos_12	so I got him this bag of xanthan gum .
9_gourmet_pos_13	I even wrapped it up real nice with wrapping paper and ribbon .
9_gourmet_pos_14	My kid opened his present
9_gourmet_pos_15	and could n't figure out what it was .
9_gourmet_pos_16	"It 's xanthan gum , """
9_gourmet_pos_17	I told him ,
9_gourmet_pos_18	It 's gum from outer space .
9_gourmet_pos_19	"From the planet Xanthan . """
9_gourmet_pos_20	My kid was busy
9_gourmet_pos_21	staring at the label .
9_gourmet_pos_22	"No it 's not , """
9_gourmet_pos_23	he slowly replied ,
9_gourmet_pos_24	"and then he began to read , """
9_gourmet_pos_25	Xanthan is made from the outer layer of a tiny , inactive bacterium
9_gourmet_pos_26	"called Xanthomonas campestris . . . """
9_gourmet_pos_27	"From the planet Xanthan ! """
9_gourmet_pos_28	I interrupted .
9_gourmet_pos_29	Since when did my kid learn to read ?
9_gourmet_pos_30	I grabbed the bag
9_gourmet_pos_31	and opened it .
9_gourmet_pos_32	"Here , """
9_gourmet_pos_33	I stuck a spoon into the white powder ,
9_gourmet_pos_34	Try some .
9_gourmet_pos_35	"It 's really good . """
9_gourmet_pos_36	My kid picked up the spoon
9_gourmet_pos_37	and smelled the white powder .
9_gourmet_pos_38	"Go on , """
9_gourmet_pos_39	I said ,
9_gourmet_pos_40	"you ` ll really like it ! """
9_gourmet_pos_41	He hesitated ,
9_gourmet_pos_42	and then stuck his tongue into the powder .
9_gourmet_pos_43	I was starting to get impatient ,
9_gourmet_pos_44	so I grabbed the spoon from him ,
9_gourmet_pos_45	Give it to me ,
9_gourmet_pos_46	"you big chicken , """
9_gourmet_pos_47	and then I swallowed the powder .
9_gourmet_pos_48	The stuff
9_gourmet_pos_49	dissolved into a thick , slimy paste in my mouth ,
9_gourmet_pos_50	but I smiled
9_gourmet_pos_51	"as I chewed it , "" Mmmmm . . ."
9_gourmet_pos_52	"this is the tastiest xanthan gum in the whole universe ! """
9_gourmet_pos_53	My kid looked at me as if I were lying .
9_gourmet_pos_54	If you like it so much ,
9_gourmet_pos_55	"then you can have it , """
9_gourmet_pos_56	he said .
9_gourmet_pos_57	"Fine , """
9_gourmet_pos_58	I replied ,
9_gourmet_pos_59	it 's too good for you
9_gourmet_pos_60	"anyway . """
9_gourmet_pos_61	I figured a little reverse psychology would do the trick .
9_gourmet_pos_62	My kid 's expression did n't change .
9_gourmet_pos_63	"Can I go now ? """
9_gourmet_pos_64	he asked .
9_gourmet_pos_65	Yeah ,
9_gourmet_pos_66	fine ,
9_gourmet_pos_67	"get out here , """
9_gourmet_pos_68	I said .
9_gourmet_pos_69	Now I 'm stuck with half a pound of xanthan gum
9_gourmet_pos_70	and I do n't know anyone with wheat allergies or celiac disease
9_gourmet_pos_71	I can give this stuff to .
9_gourmet_pos_72	Stupid kid
