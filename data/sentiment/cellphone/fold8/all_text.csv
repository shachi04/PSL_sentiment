8_cell_pos_1	For the $ 50 bucks
8_cell_pos_2	you pay here ,
8_cell_pos_3	you get the phone plus 300 minutes of airtime .
8_cell_pos_4	That 's not a bad deal
8_cell_pos_5	considering if you bought the phone
8_cell_pos_6	itself elsewhere ,
8_cell_pos_7	it would be $ 20 bucks ,
8_cell_pos_8	and buying the airtime separately would also total approximately $ 20 some odd bucks or so .
8_cell_pos_9	Plus tax .
8_cell_pos_10	So cost works about to be about the same .
8_cell_pos_11	Frankly ,
8_cell_pos_12	I see no savings to buying this phone on this site versus elsewhere .
8_cell_pos_13	Regarding the sim card ,
8_cell_pos_14	I noticed nothing unusual or problematic about insertion .
8_cell_pos_15	A sim card is a delicate silicon apparatus
8_cell_pos_16	that is highly susceptible to ESD - electro static discharge -
8_cell_pos_17	just like computer RAM is .
8_cell_pos_18	ESD is probably the primary reason
8_cell_pos_19	why so many reviewers phones here have failed .
8_cell_pos_20	I 'd bet every single one of them reside in geographical locations
8_cell_pos_21	where the weather is cold and snows .
8_cell_pos_22	Before you handle the sim card ,
8_cell_pos_23	"you should "" ground """
8_cell_pos_24	yourself by touching something metal .
8_cell_pos_25	Otherwise you run the risk of destroying the sim card with ESD .
8_cell_pos_26	The phone itself is OK .
8_cell_pos_27	It 's BASIC .
8_cell_pos_28	Emphasis on the basic .
8_cell_pos_29	I just transferred my mobile # from a Motorola V120c and notwithstanding the annoying 20 polyphonic ringtones on the c139 , about the only edge
8_cell_pos_30	the c139 has over the V120c is the color display .
8_cell_pos_31	Please also note that c139 does not have any kind of interface as to a pc so that means
8_cell_pos_32	you are stuck with the bundled ringtones and the wallpaper .
8_cell_pos_33	IMO , Motorola could have added a port
8_cell_pos_34	to accomodate a USB interface to this model .
8_cell_pos_35	It was short-sighted and just dumb not to considering the V120c - also in the same price range - has such a port .
8_cell_pos_36	Voicemail is extremely problematic to set up at this time .
8_cell_pos_37	I only just had the phone
8_cell_pos_38	activated on this past Saturday
8_cell_pos_39	-LRB- 10/28/06 -RRB-
8_cell_pos_40	and it took over 5 hours for my number to be transferred over to the new phone .
8_cell_pos_41	Also ,
8_cell_pos_42	it is an entirely new network .
8_cell_pos_43	In Southern California , the network this model TracFone uses is Cingular .
8_cell_pos_44	Suffice it to say ,
8_cell_pos_45	I followed all the instructions on the website explicitly , however Cingular just keeps regurgitating its canned message
8_cell_pos_46	that it does n't recognize my number
8_cell_pos_47	and to input my voicemail number .
8_cell_pos_48	And around and around it goes .
8_cell_pos_49	I anticipate nothing
8_cell_pos_50	"but problems with "" technical support """
8_cell_pos_51	when I contact them .
8_cell_pos_52	They are very polite as customer service reps , however they can barely speak or understand English .
8_cell_pos_53	I am
8_cell_pos_54	envisioning hours of BS with the call
8_cell_pos_55	I have to make
8_cell_pos_56	because past experience has indicated to me that these reps are not technical whatSOever .
8_cell_pos_57	Note to Tracfone :
8_cell_pos_58	Customer service reps from Mexico
8_cell_pos_59	who can barely communicate with your American consumers are most assuredly NOT TECH SUPPORT .
8_cell_pos_60	Also , I was n't overly impressed with the keypad
8_cell_pos_61	where it concerns text messaging .
8_cell_pos_62	The V120c is actually more intuitive .
8_cell_pos_63	It 's much easier to use .
8_cell_pos_64	But the c139 does have one advantage in this regard -
8_cell_pos_65	text messages cost only 0.3 units versus on the V120c , TracFone was deducting 0.5 units for each incoming and outgoing text message .
8_cell_pos_66	I 'm not sure
8_cell_pos_67	why that is considering the deduction of units has zip to do with the model of the phone .
8_cell_pos_68	It should be one uniform deduction across the board .
8_cell_pos_69	Consumers should contact TracFone customer service
8_cell_pos_70	and inquire about this phenomenon .
8_cell_pos_71	Bottom line is that I would recommend this phone to anyone
8_cell_pos_72	who is upgrading from a monochromatic LED phone
8_cell_pos_73	and wants an \* inexpensive \* phone with a much easier on the eyes color display .
8_cell_pos_74	Inexpensive as in you
8_cell_pos_75	bought
8_cell_pos_76	it from a retailer for $ 20 bucks .
8_cell_pos_77	But if you want pretty new ringtones and wallpaper , and a little more flexibility ,
8_cell_pos_78	then get
8_cell_pos_79	yourself a Nokia 2126 .
8_cell_pos_80	For the same money you spend here , the Nokia is a better phone .
8_cell_pos_81	It has a USB port , a speakerphone ,
8_cell_pos_82	plus other extras .
