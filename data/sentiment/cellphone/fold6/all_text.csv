6_cell_pos_1	Two week review
6_cell_pos_2	I got this phone to use as a phone
6_cell_pos_3	and am very happy with it .
6_cell_pos_4	I have had it about two weeks now so this is the early review .
6_cell_pos_5	First , the qualifier .
6_cell_pos_6	I have a nice canon camera
6_cell_pos_7	and do n't want to use my phone
6_cell_pos_8	to take pictures .
6_cell_pos_9	I do n't want to use my phone
6_cell_pos_10	to listen to music or surf the internet either ,
6_cell_pos_11	I just want it to make and receive calls and maybe a text here and there .
6_cell_pos_12	If you are one of those people
6_cell_pos_13	that has a different agenda for your phone ,
6_cell_pos_14	then this is probably not the phone for you .
6_cell_pos_15	The Good
6_cell_pos_16	Size is great .
6_cell_pos_17	This phone is comparable to a Hershey bar in thickness and width ,
6_cell_pos_18	but shorter .
6_cell_pos_19	It fits in my pants or shirt pocket without feeling bulky .
6_cell_pos_20	It makes a razr feel thick ,
6_cell_pos_21	but I am guessing
6_cell_pos_22	it is comparable to a slvr .
6_cell_pos_23	The Slice has good sound quality for such a small phone .
6_cell_pos_24	It also has good reception .
6_cell_pos_25	Sprints network is not the best in my area ,
6_cell_pos_26	but my slice has been able to connect
6_cell_pos_27	wherever I am and maintains a strong connection even with 1 bar .
6_cell_pos_28	When I was in the car , the road noise got too loud to hear ,
6_cell_pos_29	but
6_cell_pos_30	when I hit the speakerphone button
6_cell_pos_31	I could hear fine ,
6_cell_pos_32	and keep my hands on the wheel .
6_cell_pos_33	Virgin is definitely the most affordable option if you are not planning to use the phone a lot .
6_cell_pos_34	I expect to spend between $ 150 and $ 200 this first year ,
6_cell_pos_35	including the $ 50 up front for the phone .
6_cell_pos_36	The cheapest monthly plan on the big carriers would cost me at least 500 over a the same period with local taxes
6_cell_pos_37	and fees included .
6_cell_pos_38	Although I have n't tried them ,
6_cell_pos_39	it looks like the monthly plans with Virgin are pretty reasonable too if I start
6_cell_pos_40	getting into that kind of usage level .
6_cell_pos_41	Many of the other Virgin phones look like toys .
6_cell_pos_42	Although this ones name sounds like a toy and people under 18 recognize it ,
6_cell_pos_43	it also looks like a real piece of equipment .
6_cell_pos_44	As an older professional I am not embarrassed to plop this phone on the conference table in a meeting with the VP .
6_cell_pos_45	-LRB- in vibrate mode of course -RRB-
6_cell_pos_46	At the same time , my 12 year old is hoping
6_cell_pos_47	I hate it
6_cell_pos_48	and get another phone so he can have this one
6_cell_pos_49	because it is so cool .
6_cell_pos_50	The UI is well designed and easy to navigate except for the ridiculous menu .
6_cell_pos_51	What were they smoking
6_cell_pos_52	"when they decided to use a pig for "" my account , "" a dragon for "" messaging , """
6_cell_pos_53	etc .
6_cell_pos_54	Other than that , the features are all
6_cell_pos_55	where you would expect them to be and navigating the menus is quite intuitive .
6_cell_pos_56	Ca n't really comment on reliability on this phone
6_cell_pos_57	after just two weeks ,
6_cell_pos_58	but it has already been dropped twice
6_cell_pos_59	and still works fine .
6_cell_pos_60	The Bad
6_cell_pos_61	Perhaps because they are affordable in other ways , Virgin screws
6_cell_pos_62	you on ringtones and background .
6_cell_pos_63	The four ringtones included are unacceptable ,
6_cell_pos_64	and you are blocked from up or down
6_cell_pos_65	loading your own .
6_cell_pos_66	They do have a pretty big collection on their website
6_cell_pos_67	you can get for $ 2.50 a pop ,
6_cell_pos_68	but none of them sound like a phone .
6_cell_pos_69	The included
6_cell_pos_70	wallpapers were chosen to be the most despicable choices possible too , so you are likely to fork out $ 2.00 for a wallpaper from their web site for that as well .
6_cell_pos_71	The buttons are a little too small .
6_cell_pos_72	Most of the time I do fine ,
6_cell_pos_73	but every once in a while I hit two keys or the wrong key
6_cell_pos_74	because they are so small .
6_cell_pos_75	Of course
6_cell_pos_76	once the numbers were all
6_cell_pos_77	loaded into contacts
6_cell_pos_78	and speed dials set
6_cell_pos_79	I have n't run into that problem any more .
6_cell_pos_80	Battery life has not lived up to what I read ,
6_cell_pos_81	but that might be because of how I use it .
6_cell_pos_82	If I charge it every night
6_cell_pos_83	I am fine .
6_cell_pos_84	I ordered an extra charger
6_cell_pos_85	to keep in the office and one for the car as well just in case .
6_cell_pos_86	Summary
6_cell_pos_87	After two weeks I am happy with this phone
6_cell_pos_88	and would recommend it to someone
6_cell_pos_89	looking for a phone to use for making phone calls .
6_cell_pos_90	It is not big on extras like a camera ,
6_cell_pos_91	but what it does it does well .
6_cell_pos_92	Virgin uses Sprint 's network ,
6_cell_pos_93	see if you can find out about their network in your area
6_cell_pos_94	before you buy a Virgin phone .
6_cell_pos_95	. . .
