19_cell_neg_1	I had to return this phone twice to Motorola for keys
19_cell_neg_2	that were n't working .
19_cell_neg_3	It was too frustrating .
19_cell_neg_4	Ca n't use the phone in my house or at work although my prior Nokia worked well .
19_cell_neg_5	There are some nice things --
19_cell_neg_6	but these are externals
19_cell_neg_7	and certainly not explained in the user manual .
19_cell_neg_8	-- customisation of the front screen is do-able .
19_cell_neg_9	-- there 's a composer in the phone
19_cell_neg_10	to compose your own ringtone .
19_cell_neg_11	No mention in the user manual .
19_cell_neg_12	Stumbled across it .
19_cell_neg_13	-- Ringtones are expensive to buy from Cingular .
19_cell_neg_14	First you pay for the ringtone
19_cell_neg_15	and then
19_cell_neg_16	you pay for the access to the internet to download it .
19_cell_neg_17	A double payment .
19_cell_neg_18	The saving grace was the ability
19_cell_neg_19	to send the ringtones to myself by searching for methods on the internet .
19_cell_neg_20	-- The volume was always frustrating .
19_cell_neg_21	I was unable to find a ringtone loud enough so
19_cell_neg_22	that i could hear the phone
19_cell_neg_23	when it 's in my purse .
19_cell_neg_24	Volume controls are easy .
19_cell_neg_25	However putting the phone on vibrate was buried in the menus and not in the user manual .
19_cell_neg_26	Counterbalanced by the ability
19_cell_neg_27	to put an icon on the front screen so i could easily change it to vibrate .
19_cell_neg_28	-- I especially hate how loud the phone is
19_cell_neg_29	when you go to turn it off in a theater .
19_cell_neg_30	You ` re being responsible
19_cell_neg_31	and the phone does that annoying Moto noise .
19_cell_neg_32	It 's only silent
19_cell_neg_33	when you shut it down from silent ringing .
19_cell_neg_34	Yet to set it on silent ringing using the side buttons ,
19_cell_neg_35	you get noisy tones
19_cell_neg_36	as you lower the volume
