9_cell_pos_1	Note :
9_cell_pos_2	I am
9_cell_pos_3	transitioning from using the Sony Ericsson P910i smartphone
9_cell_pos_4	so my review is based on how well the w710i 's features work in comparison .
9_cell_pos_5	I purchased this
9_cell_pos_6	because I go to remote areas
9_cell_pos_7	and the P910i needs heavy bandwidth in order for the phone to function .
9_cell_pos_8	My son 's Z500 would work in areas
9_cell_pos_9	my p910i would not .
9_cell_pos_10	Review is based on 1 week of usage .
9_cell_pos_11	I ` ve also purchased the z710i for my son
9_cell_pos_12	and will review that one later .
9_cell_pos_13	Strengths :
9_cell_pos_14	\* Improved picture quality of 2.0 megapixels vs . 1.3
9_cell_pos_15	\* Excellent voice quality with headsets
9_cell_pos_16	-LRB- wired or bluetooth -RRB-
9_cell_pos_17	\* Text , SMS , MMS
9_cell_pos_18	\* shortcut buttons
9_cell_pos_19	to quickly use 4 of your most used features
9_cell_pos_20	\* Battery life is outstanding
9_cell_pos_21	\* mp3 player
9_cell_pos_22	\* RSS reader
9_cell_pos_23	\* Bluetooth synchronization of files

9_cell_pos_25	\* Ability to buy an international SIM card
9_cell_pos_26	to avoid extra fees
9_cell_pos_27	\* Sync cord charges the battery
9_cell_pos_28	\* Can double as a modem via bluetooth or usb cable
9_cell_pos_29	-LRB- if you do n't have unlimited internet package be very careful
9_cell_pos_30	as they charge big $ $ $ -RRB-
9_cell_pos_31	\* FM radio - reception is so-so in the downtown area
9_cell_pos_32	\* standard or flight mode option
9_cell_pos_33	to use while on airplane
9_cell_pos_34	\* Edge technology - my p10i did not have this .
9_cell_pos_35	I can download email extremely quickly now ! ! !
9_cell_pos_36	\* step counter & calories expended
9_cell_pos_37	Neutral :
9_cell_pos_38	\* The international charger with an adapter for US outlets .
9_cell_pos_39	It is very wobbly in the outlet .
9_cell_pos_40	I ` ll invest in a US version .
9_cell_pos_41	\* Inability to sync with any computer
9_cell_pos_42	using Windows Vista
9_cell_pos_43	-LRB- I 'm sure a workaround is coming -RRB-
9_cell_pos_44	\* I have n't used the armband yet
9_cell_pos_45	but it may improve the stepcounter 's accuracy .
9_cell_pos_46	\* Others have warned about holdling the phone
9_cell_pos_47	and interferring with the antenna ,
9_cell_pos_48	I have n't had a problem with this .
9_cell_pos_49	\* Over-the-ear earbuds do n't fall out !
9_cell_pos_50	Weaknesses :
9_cell_pos_51	\* Since I have other Sony phones ,
9_cell_pos_52	I am
9_cell_pos_53	disappointed
9_cell_pos_54	that they have changed the shape of the connection for the sync and charger .
9_cell_pos_55	Translation ,
9_cell_pos_56	you can no longer use the current chargers of the previous generation phones .
9_cell_pos_57	\* There is no way to charge the phone
9_cell_pos_58	and use the wired headset .
9_cell_pos_59	You either listen to the radio or charge the phone .
9_cell_pos_60	\* You can not use the standard over-the-counter headsets
9_cell_pos_61	because there is no outlet for it .
9_cell_pos_62	\* Need to switch settings
9_cell_pos_63	to view more than one email account
9_cell_pos_64	\* Yet another memory card format -LRB- micro -RRB- another adapter
9_cell_pos_65	needed
9_cell_pos_66	\* Memory card only 512mb
9_cell_pos_67	-LRB- can purchase 1 or 2gb -RRB-
9_cell_pos_68	\* picture caller id only works
9_cell_pos_69	after you open the phone
9_cell_pos_70	-LRB- edit March 21,2007 -
9_cell_pos_71	if you have answer on open set -RRB-
9_cell_pos_72	I purchased my W710i from an internet company for $ 254.00
9_cell_pos_73	and it was shipped directly from Hong Kong in 2 business days .
9_cell_pos_74	I 'm unsure if I can provide their name here .
9_cell_pos_75	Overall :
9_cell_pos_76	Sony has always produced quality products .
9_cell_pos_77	I love this phone
9_cell_pos_78	and it is a very good comparison to a SmartPhone .
9_cell_pos_79	I do miss using my styllus .
9_cell_pos_80	If you do n't need the bells and whistles of a smartphone , go for the Z710i as it is a bit cheaper but a great contender .
9_cell_pos_81	If I could rate it more than 5 stars ,
9_cell_pos_82	I would even though I have n't tried all of the features of this phone .
9_cell_pos_83	Buy it without hesitation !
9_cell_pos_84	ADDENDUM March 5 , 2007
9_cell_pos_85	I dropped the phone on a tiled bathroom floor .
9_cell_pos_86	When it hit , the clip , battery cover and battery
9_cell_pos_87	scattered in different directions on the floor .
9_cell_pos_88	Amazingly , the phone still operates .
9_cell_pos_89	The damage is a barely noticeable mark on the upper left of the phone .
9_cell_pos_90	A mark like that
9_cell_pos_91	could happen in my purse !
9_cell_pos_92	I am really impressed now
9_cell_pos_93	but hope I never do that again !
