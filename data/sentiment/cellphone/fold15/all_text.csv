15_cell_pos_1	My previous phone was the Motorola V60i with a monochrome screen with Cingular , so I am still getting
15_cell_pos_2	used to all the differences in phone capabilities
15_cell_pos_3	and have barely scratched the surface of what the i560 can do .
15_cell_pos_4	Here 's a breakdown of the pros and cons so far
15_cell_pos_5	-LRB- after a week -RRB- .
15_cell_pos_6	PROS
15_cell_pos_7	-LRB- in order of coolness , best first -RRB- :
15_cell_pos_8	1 . Nextel 's Direct Connect is amazingly fast and their network very clear .
15_cell_pos_9	2 . Any call , either DirectConnect or regular call can be made with the flip open or closed .
15_cell_pos_10	You can scroll through recent calls with the flip closed and call any of them .
15_cell_pos_11	3 . If you ` re concerned about radio
15_cell_pos_12	-LRB- RF -RRB- radiation
15_cell_pos_13	- and you should be even though nobody talks about it anymore , this phone has the extendable antenna
15_cell_pos_14	to get the transmission point further away from you
15_cell_pos_15	-LRB- and improves the transmission -RRB- .
15_cell_pos_16	4 . The speakerphone is as loud
15_cell_pos_17	as you need it to be ,
15_cell_pos_18	even at dinning room table with the TV on and the sound
15_cell_pos_19	patched through the stereo system
15_cell_pos_20	-LRB- very impressive -RRB- .
15_cell_pos_21	There is virtually no lag in the switch between listening and speaking using the speakerphone
15_cell_pos_22	-LRB- full duplex -RRB- .
15_cell_pos_23	You can also turn its volume down
15_cell_pos_24	to a whisper if you want to .
15_cell_pos_25	5 .
15_cell_pos_26	The phone is a little wider than some phones
15_cell_pos_27	-LRB- like the V60 -RRB- ,
15_cell_pos_28	but is very light .
15_cell_pos_29	Yet the phone meets the tough Military specs .
15_cell_pos_30	6 . Rubberized grips on the phone make it easy to grip
15_cell_pos_31	and dial with one hand
15_cell_pos_32	and phone has a comfortable feel in my medium-sized hand .
15_cell_pos_33	Phone has slight hourglass
15_cell_pos_34	shape
15_cell_pos_35	-LRB- wider at the bottom -RRB-
15_cell_pos_36	to fit nicely into the hand .
15_cell_pos_37	7 .
15_cell_pos_38	Charger charges the battery FAST . . .
15_cell_pos_39	MUCH faster than my V60 ever charged .
15_cell_pos_40	8 . Phone has all the standard stuff
15_cell_pos_41	I love and could n't live without :
15_cell_pos_42	voice dialing , custom rings for calls from my contact list , handsfree , long recent calls list
15_cell_pos_43	-LRB- up to 20 -RRB- , ability to store number
15_cell_pos_44	to Contacts from recent calls
15_cell_pos_45	-LRB- without having to key the number ,
15_cell_pos_46	just have to enter the name -RRB- .
15_cell_pos_47	CONS
15_cell_pos_48	-LRB- in order of annoyance , worst first -RRB- :
15_cell_pos_49	1 . The phone is almost completely made of plastic , and I ` ve never thought plastic was as durable as metal .
15_cell_pos_50	While Motorola makes truly awesome phones ,
15_cell_pos_51	I worry there might be an over-reliance on plastic to protect the insides of the phone .
15_cell_pos_52	2 .
15_cell_pos_53	When the phone is in the holster , the outside display is not visible ,
15_cell_pos_54	forcing
15_cell_pos_55	me to remove the phone from the holster
15_cell_pos_56	to see
15_cell_pos_57	who 's calling -LRB- for those
15_cell_pos_58	that do n't have a custom ring
15_cell_pos_59	configured -RRB-
15_cell_pos_60	or to check the time .
15_cell_pos_61	Very annoying ,
15_cell_pos_62	as I 'm used to using my phone as a watch .
15_cell_pos_63	3 . The icons on the outside display are small
15_cell_pos_64	and those who are overdue for a new eye prescription might have trouble
15_cell_pos_65	seeing and interpreting the icons .
15_cell_pos_66	The only two parts
15_cell_pos_67	that are clear :
15_cell_pos_68	the battery
15_cell_pos_69	-LRB- important -RRB-
15_cell_pos_70	and date\/time .
15_cell_pos_71	4 . The flimsy port cover at bottom of the phone
15_cell_pos_72	-LRB-
15_cell_pos_73	where you connect the charger , etc -RRB- make
15_cell_pos_74	me think
15_cell_pos_75	that someday I 'm going to look down
15_cell_pos_76	there
15_cell_pos_77	and find it missing .
15_cell_pos_78	It 's easy enough
15_cell_pos_79	to pop off ,
15_cell_pos_80	"but sometimes takes "" persuading """
15_cell_pos_81	to put back
15_cell_pos_82	and have it cover the slot completely
15_cell_pos_83	-LRB-
15_cell_pos_84	because it needs to be a snug fit
15_cell_pos_85	to meet the military spec -RRB- .
15_cell_pos_86	OVERALL ,
15_cell_pos_87	I really like the phone
15_cell_pos_88	and highly recommend it to all
