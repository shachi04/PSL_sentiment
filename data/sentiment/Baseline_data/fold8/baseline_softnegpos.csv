positive	0.0001	0.0001	a  lot  of  people  say 
positive	0.1875	0.4166666666666667	that  Motorola  's  hardware  was  very  good  , 
negative	0.125	0.25	but  that  their  software  left  a  lot  to  be  desired  . 
positive	0.5	0.125	Nonetheless  I  decided  to  try  this  phone  out 
positive	0.0001	0.375	when  it  came  time  to  start  a  new  cell  plan  . 
positive	0.0001	0.25	I  had  made  the  decision 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	to  switch  to  T-mobile 
positive	0.25	0.75	and  this  looked  like  one  of  the  best  phone  options  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	Right  off  the  bat 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  found  out 
negative	0.1875	0.25	that  the  people  who  criticized  Moto  's  software  were  right  on  the  money  . 
negative	0.40625	0.2916666666666667	There  are  a  host  of  poorly  designed  software  aspects  of  this  phone  ,  not  the  least  of  which  is  the  --  frankly  --  idiotic  way 
negative	0.125	0.25	the  phone  book  is  designed  . 
positive	0.0001	0.125	Eventually  I  made  peace  with  all  of  the  things 
positive	0.5	0.25	I  disliked  about  the  V360  since  at  least  it  seemed  to  work  well  enough  as  a  phone  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	As  time  went  by  I  started  noticing 
negative	0.1875	0.25	that  I  was  missing  a  lot  of  calls  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	The  phone  would  be  in  my  bag  or  in  my  pocket  or  sitting  on  my  desk 
negative	0.0001	0.25	when  suddenly  it  would  ring  with  the  voicemail  notification  from  a  message  that  I  had  received  anywhere  from  minutes 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  hours 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	before  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	During  the  course  of  the  last  few  months 
negative	0.3125	0.3125	-LRB-  the  phone  is  less  than  a  year  old  -RRB- 
negative	0.0001	0.25	I  `  ve  also  found  that  it  has  begun 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	crashing  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	A  lot  . 
negative	0.25	0.0001	"Opening  or  closing  it  will  result  in  a  ""  white  screen  of  death  .  "" "
negative	0.125	0.1875	Putting  it  on  the  charger  will  cause  it  to  switch  back  and  forth  between  the  messages  that  it  is  charging  , 
negative	0.40625	0.25	that  it  is  unable  to  charge  and  that  it  's  SIM  card  can  not  be  found  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	after  a  few  minutes 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	of  which  it  will  simply  shut  itself  off  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	With  a  full  battery  charge  it  will  continually  shut  itself  off  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	At  this  point  I  am 
negative	0.125	0.375	forced  to  conclude 
negative	0.25	0.375	that  this  phone  is  an  absolute  piece  of  junk  . 
negative	0.125	0.3125	I  am  also  forced  to  conclude 
negative	0.125	0.25	that  it  is  n't  the  only  model 
negative	0.125	0.25	which  is  . 
negative	0.0001	0.4166666666666667	None  of  my  coworkers  has  ever  had  a  good  experience  with  a  Motorola  phone  . 
negative	0.625	0.25	My  wife  's  Motorola  has  shown  its  own  host  of  problems  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	People  working  for  T-mobile  at  several  stores 
negative	0.0001	0.25	I  have  visited  have  confided 
negative	0.375	0.0001	that  they  never  ,  ever  recommend  Motorola  phones  to  anyone  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	In  fact 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  `  ve  had  T-mobile  employees  urge 
negative	0.625	0.0001	me  to  not  buy  any  phones  from  them  , 
negative	0.5	0.5	but  rather  to  shop  for  an  unlocked  Nokia  online  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	So  that  's  what  I  'm  going  to  do  . 
negative	0.0001	0.375	Until  I  can  buy  a  new  phone 
negative	0.125	0.375	all  I  can  do  is  recharge  this  phone  every  night  ,  restart  it  five  or  six  times  a  day  , 
negative	0.4375	0.125	and  keep  apologizing  to  my  friends  ,  family  and  employers  for  always  missing  their  calls 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	So  I  bought  this  thing 
positive	0.0001	0.125	based  on  the  Amazon  reviews 
positive	0.0001	0.5	and  saved  a  bundle  over  the  local  retail  cost 
positive	0.0001	0.125	-LRB-  yeah  Amazon  !  -RRB-  , 
positive	0.625	0.0001	but  that  's  not 
positive	0.0001	0.125	why  I  'm  writing  this  review  . 
positive	0.5	0.125	I  'd  like  to  talk  about  the  performance  and  comfort  of  the  Earboom  . 
positive	0.375	0.34375	The  eargel  thingies  are  designed  quite  well  ,  of  the  three  different  sizes  for  each  ear 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	you  `  re  bound  to  find  one 
positive	0.1875	0.5	that  fits  very  comfortably  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Turns  out  I  could  n't  find  any 
negative	0.25	0.125	that  fit  my  right  ear  comfortably  for  extended  periods  of  use 
positive	0.5625	0.0001	but  found  a  perfect  fit  in  my  mate  on  the  other  side  . 
negative	0.0001	0.375	My  wife  had  the  exact  opposite  experience  -  hopefully  our  daughter  will  inherit  more  symmetrical  ears  ! 
positive	0.625	0.125	I  hate  jogging  so  ca  n't  comment  on  the  fit  during  that  activity 
positive	0.0001	0.75	but  can  say  the  gels  fit 
positive	0.0001	0.25	suprising  well  in  the  folds  of  your  ear 
positive	0.2916666666666667	0.25	and  the  boom  is  quite  secure 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	when  installed  . 
positive	0.5	0.25	I  'd  have  to  imagine 
positive	0.125	0.25	it  'd  take  a  big  hit 
positive	0.0001	0.375	to  knock  it  loose  once  in  place  . 
positive	0.125	0.3125	Sound  quality  from  the  earbud  is  decent  , 
negative	0.25	0.125	but  I  feel 
negative	0.25	0.125	the  Earboom  lacks  some  fidelity  ,  especially  the  higher  frequencies  . 
negative	0.4583333333333333	0.25	Normally  this  is  not  a  problem  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	but  it  can  sometimes  make  the  person 
negative	0.125	0.0001	you  `  re  talking  to  sound  like  Isaac  Hayes  . 
positive	0.16666666666666666	0.175	The  speaker  is  plently  loud  and  the  lack  of  high  frequencies  allows  you  to  tune  into  the  tonal  range 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	where  us  humans  tend  to  converse  , 
positive	0.0001	0.25	without  having  the  voices 
positive	0.125	0.0001	washed  over  with  background  noise  . 
positive	0.375	0.0001	The  gels  block  an  appropriate  amount  of  external  sounds 
positive	0.0001	0.5	allowing  you  to  concentrate  on  the  discussion  at  hand  without  impeding  your  ability 
positive	0.0001	0.125	to  hear  say 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	an  ambulance  while  driving  . 
positive	0.25	0.25	There  is  a  small  slot  on  the  gels 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	that  funnels  some  external  noise  to  your  drum  , 
positive	0.0001	0.75	while  the  rest  of  the  gel  fits  snug  to  the  ear 
positive	0.5	0.0001	blocking  out  other  stray  noise  paths  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  `  ve  asked  people 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	how  I  sound 
positive	0.125	0.375	and  thus  far  the  feedback  has  been  positive  , 
negative	0.125	0.3333333333333333	my  voice  comes  through  loud  and  clear  despite  the  boom  's  apparent  lack  of  length  , 
positive	0.0001	0.125	reinforcing  my  belief 
positive	0.375	0.125	that  size  DOES  N'T  matter  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	In  fact  , 
negative	0.25	0.21875	I  have  found  the  mic  to  be  very  sensitive  to  even  small  sounds  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Forget  talking  on  the  phone 
negative	0.0001	0.125	and  subtly  typing  on  the  keyboard  our  mouse  click  surfing  - 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	they  `  ll  hear  every  click  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Another  example  , 
negative	0.125	0.25	I  was  in  my  house 
negative	0.625	0.0001	and  the  person  on  the  other  end  could  hear  the  kids 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	playing  in  the  pool  40  feet  away 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	with  the  house  windows  closed  !  ! 
negative	0.125	0.25	Yes  ,  the  mic  is  that  sensitive  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	Even  while  driving  they  could  hear 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	when  I  shifted  gears  . 
positive	0.4583333333333333	0.0001	Not  that  it  's  obtrusive  to  the  other  person  on  the  phone  , 
positive	0.125	0.5	it  's  just  good  to  be  aware 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	they  can  hear  it  all  . 
positive	0.375	0.125	What  more  to  say  about  such  a  simple  device  . 
positive	0.25	0.25	Form  Fit  and  Function  are  all  there  and  I  would  recommend  this  product  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	In  fact  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  just  ordered  another  - 
positive	0.0001	0.25	it  makes  a  great  gift 
positive	0.375	0.35	I  have  been  using  a  Chemex  10-cup  coffee  maker  for  several  weeks  and  have  never  had  such  good  coffee  before  in  my  life  . 
positive	0.1875	0.20833333333333331	I  am  constantly  looking  forward  to  my  next  pot  of  coffee  ! 
negative	0.125	0.1875	There  is  a  downside  to  this  coffee  maker  : 
negative	0.125	0.25	it  is  a  more  manual  procedure  than  what  you  are  used  to  , 
negative	0.125	0.0001	and  it  also  takes  a  couple  of  pots 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  learn 
negative	0.0001	0.25	how  to  use  this  most  efficiently  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	The  first  time  I  tried  to  use  mine  , 
negative	0.25	0.1875	I  had  ground  my  coffee  way  too  finely  and  it  just  took  forever  ! 
negative	0.125	0.25	The  big  time  consumers  : 
negative	0.0001	0.25	you  have  to  boil  your  water  separately 
negative	0.0001	0.25	-LRB-  you  do  have  a  water  kettle  right  ?  -RRB- 
negative	0.0001	0.25	and  then  you  have  to  gradually  pour  the  boiled  water  through  the  Chemex  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	This  means  that  while  the  coffee  is  brewing  , 
negative	0.125	0.1875	you  are  pouring  ,  or  watching  ,  or  giving  the  filter  area  a  bit  of  a  stir  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Now  the  up  side  : 
positive	0.625	0.875	you  will  never  ever  ever  drink  a  better  cup  of  coffee  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  use  filtered  water  ,  freshly  ground  home  roasted  beans  ,  and  this  Chemex  to  produce  the  finest  coffee 
positive	0.0001	0.25	I  have  ever  had  the  pleasure  of  drinking  . 
positive	0.125	0.25	And  this  coffee  is  a  pleasure  ! 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	In  fact  , 
positive	0.125	0.375	I  `  ve  totally  given  up  using  cream  and  sugar 
positive	0.125	0.25	because  my  coffee  no  longer  has  anything  to  hide  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Another  up  side  : 
positive	0.375	0.5	clean  up  means 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	swishing  the  Chemex  with  warm  water 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  tossing  the  water  down  the  drain  . 
positive	0.125	0.0001	You  can  also  wash  with  a  bottle  brush 
positive	0.125	0.4375	but  this  is  rarely  necessary  . 
positive	0.125	0.4375	A  brief  swish  is  really  all 
positive	0.0001	0.125	it  takes  to  get  your  Chemex 
positive	0.0001	0.375	looking  factory  new  . 
positive	0.0001	0.125	Try  that  with  your  electric  drip  machine  ! 
positive	0.625	0.375	Ha  !  That  thing  will  NEVER  look  brand  new  ! 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Oh  ,  here  's  a  final  upside  : 
positive	0.0001	0.75	this  Chemex  brews  the  best  coffee 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	you  `  ll  ever  drink  , 
positive	0.5	0.0001	and  it  costs  less  than  just  about  anything  . 
positive	0.125	0.1875	You  are  probably  already  spending  more  money  than  this  every  month  at  Starbucks  ! 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Go  ahead 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  buy  yourself  one  of  these  . 
negative	0.0001	0.625	If  necessary  ,  wake  up  10  minutes  earlier  to  make  your  coffee  . 
positive	0.0001	0.375	Better  yet  ,  wake  up  20  minutes  earlier  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	And 
positive	0.125	0.25	when  your  coffee  is  ready  ,  instead  of  dumping  it  into  a  travel  cup 
positive	0.125	0.0001	and  bolting  out  the  door  ,  sit  down 
positive	0.0001	0.375	and  enjoy  your  first  cup  for  the  next  10  minutes  . 
positive	0.125	0.75	You  deserve  it  ! 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	UPDATE  : 
positive	0.125	0.25	It  's  been  a  year  now 
positive	0.125	0.5	and  I  still  love  this  Chemex  . 
negative	0.5	0.125	However  ,  over  time  the  glass  acquired  a  coffee  color  tinge 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	that  gradually  became  darker  with  each  use  . 
negative	0.3125	0.2916666666666667	Nothing  I  tried  got  it  clean  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	but  something  my  wife  tried  did  : 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	a  splash  of  bleach  in  otherwise  clean  water 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	followed  by  a  thorough  swishing  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	Now  my  Chemex 
positive	0.0001	0.375	looks  brand  new 
negative	0.0001	0.375	My  wife  bought  this  one  from  Best  Buy  without  me  reviewing 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	it  1st  . 
positive	0.0001	0.125	Amazingly  , 
positive	0.0001	0.1875	I  would  have  bought  it  after  reading  the  reviews  here  . 
negative	0.0001	0.75	I  'm  starting  to  wonder 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	who  writes  these  things  .  .  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	LG  employees  ? 
positive	0.25	0.25	The  microwave  is  fine  -  no  complaints  . 
negative	0.3333333333333333	0.3333333333333333	The  toaster  ,  however  ,  is  an  unmitigated  disaster  . 
negative	0.25	0.25	I  am  of  the  opinion  that  you  should  rarely  combine  appliances 
negative	0.125	0.1875	-  this  appliance  is  a  poster  child  for  this  thought  . 
negative	0.0001	0.625	The  toaster  browns  extremely  unevenly  and  inconsistently 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB-  sometimes  you  should  toast  the  same  piece  of  bread  on  5 
negative	0.25	0.125	and  sometimes  as  high  as  10  !  -RRB-  . 
negative	0.0001	0.625	More  importantly  ,  the  toaster  broke 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	after  31  days 
negative	0.0001	0.375	-LRB-  coincidently  the  Best  Buy  return  policy

positive	0.0001	0.0001	LG  picks  up  the  phone  quickly 
positive	0.0001	0.375	and  they  honor  the  warranty  . 
negative	0.375	0.25	The  problem  is  they  ca  n't  think  outside  of  the  box  . 
positive	0.125	0.1875	They  had  me  get  it  repaired 
negative	0.0001	0.1875	but  I  have  to  inconveniently  drive  it  out  there 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  pick  it  up  -  OK  .  .  . 
positive	0.625	0.0001	no  problem  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	One  day  later  ? 
negative	0.125	0.25	It  breaks  again  . 
negative	0.4375	0.4375	It  is  an  extremely  poorly  built  appliance  and  the  repair  people  thought

negative	0.375	0.25	That  's  how  bad  it  was  .

negative	0.25	0.0001	-LRB-  great  option  -  costs  LG  money  ,

negative	0.0001	0.0001	Confusing  ? 
negative	0.0001	0.25	Yes  ! 
negative	0.375	0.25	The  problem  is  it  does  n't  work  with  \*  all  \*  Nokia  phones  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	While  browsing  at  the  store

positive	0.0001	0.0001	the  3590  -RRB-  ; 
positive	0.375	0.125	which  piqued  my  curiosity  . 
positive	0.125	0.375	And  so  I  went  to  the  friendly  manager  of  the  store  that  I  was  in  and  he  opened  two  of  the  different  packages  for  me 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  let 
positive	0.0001	0.375	me  test  both  of  them  . 
negative	0.625	0.0001	One  of  them  worked  ,  the  other  did  n't  . 
positive	0.375	0.20833333333333331	The  strange  part  of  it  was  that  we  could  n't  see  a  visible  difference  in  the  two  units  .  .  . 
positive	0.2916666666666667	0.1875	and  then  one  of  us  noticed  that  on  one  of  them  the  jack  had  two  small  black  stripes  around  it 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB-  that  's  this  one  ,  and  if  you  look  closely  at  the  picture

positive	0.0001	0.0001	Curious  . 
positive	0.125	0.4166666666666667	So  my  advice  is  to  either  know  your  phone  well

positive	0.0001	0.5	or  ask  for  help

positive	0.0001	0.0001	All  in  all  4  of  5  stars  . 
positive	0.3125	0.125	I  'd  give  it  5  stars  on  performance  and  comfort  ,

negative	0.375	0.25	Several  months  later  the  little  piece  of  foam  has  fallen  from  the  end  of  the  boom  so  that  any  sound  from  the  wind  becomes  almost  unbearably  loud  for  the  person  at  the  other  end  .  .  .

negative	0.125	0.25	this  is  a  bit  of  an  annoyance  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Also  ,  for  a  while 
negative	0.375	0.25	I  was  having  a  problem 
negative	0.625	0.125	where  the  earpiece  would  cut  out  for  seconds  at  a  time  so  that  I  could  n't  hear  the  person  on  the  other  end  of  the  line 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	-LRB-  and  ,  likewise  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	they  could  n't  hear  me  -RRB- 
negative	0.25	0.125	unless  I  jiggled  the  little  jack  .

negative	0.125	0.375	Either  way  ,  it  's  something  buyers  should  be  aware  of

positive	0.0001	0.5625	because  it  has  a  better  operator  . 
negative	0.25	0.375	Good  results  require

positive	0.125	0.375	you  might  as  well  just  make  drip  coffee  . 
positive	0.1875	0.375	The  secret  good  expresso  ,  in  my  experience  ,  is  25  %  expresso  machine  and  75  %  grinder  .
