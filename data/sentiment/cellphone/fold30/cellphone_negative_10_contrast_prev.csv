10_cell_neg_8	negative	False	10_cell_neg_7	-LRB- except maybe the camera button -RRB- ,

10_cell_neg_12	negative	False	10_cell_neg_11	However , due to the padding and the nature of the metal materials , the case is very thick and bulky -
10_cell_neg_13	negative	False	10_cell_neg_12	when using the belt clip , the phone sticks out far

10_cell_neg_16	negative	False	10_cell_neg_15	BUT , the deciding factor in my two-star rating is that this case was the cause of the only two times I have dropped my Cingular 8525 -LRB-

10_cell_neg_28	negative	False	10_cell_neg_27	but it is still dangerous
10_cell_neg_29	negative	False	10_cell_neg_28	and caution is DEFINATELY in order .
10_cell_neg_30	positive	False	10_cell_neg_29	My favorite thing about this case is that you can open the case
