10_gourmet_pos_1	I bought a few bags of these noodles
10_gourmet_pos_2	after reading a very favorable review of them on the Hungry Girl website ,
10_gourmet_pos_3	and I am glad
10_gourmet_pos_4	that I did .
10_gourmet_pos_5	They work well in a number of different recipes , are filling ,
10_gourmet_pos_6	"and add a "" calcium boost "" to the dishes"
10_gourmet_pos_7	I use them in , for very few calories .
10_gourmet_pos_8	"These are not "" pasta "" type noodles , of course -"
10_gourmet_pos_9	the texture is different
10_gourmet_pos_10	"-LRB- softer and kind of "" slippery "" -RRB- ,"
10_gourmet_pos_11	and they have virtually no flavor of their own -
10_gourmet_pos_12	they take on the flavor
10_gourmet_pos_13	of whatever sauce or dressing you
10_gourmet_pos_14	use with them .
10_gourmet_pos_15	I probably wo n't use these noodles with European-style or American-style sauces such as marinara or cheese sauce - those types of sauces were created for grain-based pastas ,
10_gourmet_pos_16	which these are not .
10_gourmet_pos_17	On the other hand , these noodles are fine in such Asian recipes as Pad Thai , Lo Mein and Dan-Dan Noodes
10_gourmet_pos_18	-LRB- basically , noodles in a spicy peanut or sesame sauce -RRB- .
10_gourmet_pos_19	There are a lot of Asian-style recipes in cookbooks and on the Internet
10_gourmet_pos_20	which are fairly easy to make , taste terrific ,
10_gourmet_pos_21	and work beautifully with these noodles .
10_gourmet_pos_22	You can prepare yourself a real treat ,
10_gourmet_pos_23	if you use these noodles in the types of recipes
10_gourmet_pos_24	that work well with their texture ,
10_gourmet_pos_25	and for a fraction of the calories
10_gourmet_pos_26	you 'd eat if using regular noodles or rice .
10_gourmet_pos_27	In short ,
10_gourmet_pos_28	if you attempt something like spaghetti with meatballs or chicken cacciatore
10_gourmet_pos_29	using these noodles ,
10_gourmet_pos_30	you ` re likely to be disappointed ,
10_gourmet_pos_31	but if you use them in Pad Thai , any type of curry , other Asian dishes , or most soups ,
10_gourmet_pos_32	you ` re likely to find yourself enjoying a delicious and wonderfully low-cal , low-carb meal .
10_gourmet_pos_33	One thing
10_gourmet_pos_34	-
10_gourmet_pos_35	when you open the bag ,
10_gourmet_pos_36	there is a slight ammonia-like odor
10_gourmet_pos_37	-LRB- it smells ammonia-like to me , anyway -RRB- .
10_gourmet_pos_38	If you rinse the noodles well
10_gourmet_pos_39	and then parboil them for a few minutes , as per the package directions ,
10_gourmet_pos_40	the odor really does disappear .
10_gourmet_pos_41	It is not a strong odor ,
10_gourmet_pos_42	it wo n't permeate your kitchen or anything like that ,
10_gourmet_pos_43	but you will definitely want to rinse and parboil the noodles before using them .
10_gourmet_pos_44	Just follow the package directions
