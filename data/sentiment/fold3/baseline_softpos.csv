and  Hoover  only  gives  you  that  little  compartment  for  the  dirt 	0.0001
so  it  gets  caught  in  the  vacuum  behind  the  hepa  filter  . 	0.125
You  spend  more  time  cleaning  out  the  vacuum 	0.125

Today  I  had  to  pick  up  the  vacuum 	0.1875

Tazo  's  assortment  ,  and  Tazo  teas  in  general  ,  are  fine  --  better  than  premium  teas  like  Stash  or  Celestial  Seasonings  -- 	0.5625
but  not  anywhere  near  as  good  as  Numi  ,  or  Aspen  ,  or  other  super  premium  teas 	0.75
"made  with  only  ""  real  ""  ingredients  and  minus  all  of  the  flavorings  . "	0.0001
I  'm  more  used  to  these  high  quality  teas  , 	0.25
which  Tazo  attempts  to  be  , 	0.25
but  disappoints  .  .  . 	0.0001
so  overall  Tazo  Assorted  gets  a  3.5  to  a  4  . 	0.125
For  this  review  , 	0.125
I  'm  rounding  up  , 	0.0001
since  so  many  people  seem  to  enjoy  these  teas  , 	0.375
and  I  'm  in  the  clear  minority  . 	0.5
If  your  tea  experience  so  far  is  drinking  commercial  teas  of  a  lower  quality  ,  no  doubt  Tazo  's  teas  will  appeal  to  you  , 	0.25
as  they  are  a  great  improvement  . 	0.3125
They  have  a  lot  of  variety  and  many  interesting  tea  experiences  . 	0.3125
If  you  do  n't  enjoy  Tazo  's  teas  ,  though  ,  know 	0.375
that  there  are  many  ,  many  teas  made  with  all  real  ingredients  ,  teas 	0.25
that  cost  only  a  fraction  more  , 	0.0001
that  may  be  just  the  thing 	0.25

I  know  of  many  people 	0.0001
who  would  love  to  have  an  elk  carcass  for  their  holiday  . 	0.375
Birthdays  ,  Christmas  ,  Hanukkah  ,  Martin  Luther  King  Jr.  '  s  Birthday  Observed  ,  Grandparent  's  Day  ,  etc  .  are  all  holidays 	0.25
where  a  big  piece  of  elk  meat  could  brighten  someone  's  day  . 	0.25
But  watch  out  !  !  ! 	0.125
I  have  often  used  Amazon  in  order  to  buy  gifts  , 	0.20833333333333331
and  with  this  elk  carcass  GIFT  WRAPPING  IS  NOT  AN  OPTION  . 	0.25
I  would  think 	0.0001
that  half  the  fun  of  giving  a  huge  elk  carcass  would  be  watching  the  look 	0.25
on  your  loved  one  's  face  as  he  or  she  unwrapped  the  slab  of  meat  . 	0.5
Unfortunately  ,  Amazon  does  not  think 	0.125
this  is  so  . 	0.25
With  the  weight  of  the  product  , 	0.0001
I  think 	0.0001
it  is  going  to  be  difficult  to  wrap  this  on  my  own  . 	0.25
Sorry  Uncle  Tino  ,  no  elk  carcass  for  Columbus  Day  this  year  ! 	0.0001
I  would  n't  buy  this 	0.0001
unless  it  's  an  emergency  , 	0.125
because  it  's  one  of  those  chargers 	0.125
that  reports  errors  , 	0.0001
and  makes  your  phone  start  beeping  non-stop 	0.0001
when  it  's  done  charging  . 	0.0001
I  do  n't  want  this 	0.25
because  I  like  charging  at  night  ,  the  other  chargers  do  n't  do  this 	0.125
-LRB-  I  guess  what  it  does  is  it  starts  fluctuating  power  from  the  wall  ,  like  switching  off  , 	0.1875
when  the  battery  is  fully  charged  .  . 	0.25
so  it  beeps  as  if  it  's  being  plugged  in  over 	0.25
and  over  -RRB-  . 	0.0001
When  I  first  got  it  , 	0.125
I  was  trying  to  carefully  plug  it  into  my  phone  --  and  I  did  n't  want  to  damage  the  little  metal  things  inside  my  phone  OR  on  the  charger  . 	0.20833333333333331
It  was  n't  going  in  smoothly 	0.1875
and  it  did  n't  match  up 	0.375
or  seem  to  fit  inside  at  ALL  . 	0.75
So  I  went  a  day  without  a  phone 	0.0001
and  I  did  more  research  to  see 	0.0001
why  the  heck  they  'd  lie  that  it  fit  my  phone  . 	0.75
Finally  I  got 	0.125
fed  up 	0.0001
because  I  could  n't  find  another  charger  ANYWHERE 	0.125
where  I  live 	0.0001
and  I  tried 	0.0001
forcing  it  . 	0.0001
FINALLY 	0.0001
it  fit  ! 	0.75
But  I  had  to  shove  it  in  .  . 	0.25
who  knows  if  it  was  damaging  my  phone  . 	0.25
But  it  was  charging 	0.25
so  I  was  happy 	0.5625
-LRB-  my  cell  is  my  only  phone  .  . 	0.25
so  I  was  cut  off  from  the  world  -RRB-  . 	0.1875
Then  I  tried  getting  it  out 	0.125
and  could  n't  figure  it  out  ! 	0.0001
I  had  to  jimmy  it  off  , 	0.25
and  broke  off  one  of  the  side  hooks 	0.25
that  helps  it  secure  itself  . 	0.25
I  was  able  to  put  it  back  on  ,  and  finally  learned  a  routine  so  to  speak  ,  for  taking  it  off  , 	0.20833333333333331
but  it  's  cheap  . 	0.0001
It  's  very  cheap  . 	0.25
So  ,  the  charger  works  , 	0.125
but  it  's  very  hard  to  use  and  it  is  n't  convenient  at  all  . 	0.375
I  do  n't  recommend  it 	0.0001
unless  it  's  an  emergency  . 	0.125
For  me  , 	0.0001
it  was 	0.25
I  just  purchased  this  phone  four  days  ago 	0.0001
and  have  been  impressed  with  it  for  the  most  part  . 	0.20833333333333331
The  first  thing  you  `  ll  notice  is  how  crisp  and  clear  the  screen  is  . 	0.3333333333333333
This  is  a  slider  phone  , 	0.25
and  thankfully  you  can  do  most  things  without  sliding  the  screen 	0.0001
to  expose  the  number  keys  . 	0.125
The  only  things  that  I  can  think  of  thus  far 	0.0001
that  requires  you  to  expose  the  keys  is  to  dial  a  new  number 	0.25
that  's  not  in  your  contacts  and  to  text  message  . 	0.375
Next  , 	0.0001
we  go  to  the  features  . 	0.0001
So  we  got  a  1.3  MP  camera  ,  camcorder  ,  music  player  ,  1GB  microSD  card  ,  bluetooth  support  ,  and  infrared  port  .  . 	0.125
and  \*  drumroll  please  \*  an  FM  radio  . 	0.0001
Now  ,  the  FM  radio  is  n't  satellite 	0.25
based  ,  so  you  can  not  pick  up  radio  stations  from  across  the  U.  S  .  , 	0.0001
just  those  stations  local  to  you  . 	0.0001
Now  I  will  go  into  the  good  and  bad  things  about  each  feature  : 	0.75
1  .  Camera  -  Impressive  picture  quality  . 	0.375
Yes  it  's  only  1.3  MP  compared  to  those  8MP  digital  cameras  , 	0.1875
but  can  you  show  me  a  camera 	0.0001
that  does  what  this  phone  does  ? 	0.0001
5\/5 	0.0001
2  .  Camcorder  -  Not  all  that  impressive  . 	0.125
While  you  are  recording  , 	0.25
the  quality  seems  perfect  . 	0.375
However  , 	0.125
once  you  play  it  , 	0.0001
it  turns  a  bit  distorted  . 	0.0001
Plus  , 	0.625
it  only  allows  for  20  seconds  of  recording  time  regardless  of  the  size  of  your  microSD  card  . 	0.125
3\/5 	0.0001
3  .  Music  Player  -  Impressive  . 	0.0001
The  speaker  is  of  good  quality  ,  and  very  loud  . 	0.4
However  , 	0.125
I  still  could  not  find  a  way  to  change  the  order  of  the  songs  without  making  a  playlist  . 	0.0001
There  's  play  ,  pause  ,  next  song  ,  previous  song  ,  fast  forward  ,  and  rewind  features 	0.125
as  buttons  as  shown  in  the  pictures  . 	0.0001
The  buttons  must  be  pressed  fairly  hard  , 	0.16666666666666666
so  your  music  wo  n't  start  playing  spontaneously  in  your  pocket  . 	0.125
Also  ,  I  was  blown  away  on  how  the  quality  of  the  music  improves 	0.3125
once  you  put  on  those  stock  earbuds  . 	0.0001
4\/5 	0.0001
4  .  FM  Radio  -  I  bet  those 	0.0001
that  have  this  phone  tried  to  use  the  radio 	0.25
but  stopped  short 	0.0001
and  told  you 	0.0001
to  buy  an  enhancement  . 	0.375
Well  ,  the  truth  is  you  do  n't  need  to  buy  anything  extra  . 	0.375
Just  plug  in  the  earbuds 	0.0001
that  came  with  the  phone  , 	0.0001
and  this  will  serve  as  an  '  antenna  ' 	0.0001
and  will  allow  you  to  hear  stations  . 	0.0001
And  since  you  need  the  earbuds  to  hear  the  radio  , 	0.25
yes  the  sound  will  go  to  the  earbuds  . 	0.25
However  , 	0.125
there  's  a  '  loudspeaker  '  option 	0.0001
that  allows  the  radio  to  be  played  through  the  external  speaker  , 	0.25
but  you  still  need  to  keep  the  earbuds  plugged  in  , 	0.25
as  it  serves  as  the  '  antenna  '  . 	0.0001
This  means  that  if  you  want  to  hear  the  radio  on  your  phone  , 	0.25
you  NEED  to  have  the  earbuds  with  you  . 	0.25
You  may  need  to  play  around  with  the  position  of  the  phone  and  antenna 	0.25
-LRB-  or  you  may  have  to  move  -RRB- 	0.25
in  order  to  get  clear  reception  . 	0.375

Then  to  use  it  , 	0.0001
it  takes  several  steps  , 	0.0001
which  is  not  hard  , 	0.1875
but  inconvenient  . 	0.0001
The  interface  shows  the  month  and  date  , 	0.125

Ok  let 	0.0001
me  start  by  saying 	0.0001
I  am  not  a  coffee  snob  , 	0.25
I  am  more  of  a  coffee  nut  , 	0.25
I  very  much  prefer  a  cup  of  my  nice  dark  italian  roast 	0.34375
but  if  the  neighbor  offers  me  a  cup  of  his  foldgers 	0.0001
I  wont  turn  up  my  nose  . 	0.0001
And  for  a  guy  like  me  this  machine  is  perfect  !  ! 	0.4375
I  looked  at  the  500  dollar  machines 	0.0001
but  just  couldnt  see 	0.0001
spending 	0.0001
that  for  something  I  see  myself  using  4-5  days  out  of  the  week  so  I  setteled  on  this  machine 	0.0001
and  I  have  not  one  regret  . 	0.25
I  have  had  the  machine  about  3  weeks  now  , 	0.25
I  admit  I  dont  use  it  every  day  as  I  have  thoses  mornings 	0.1875
where  I  am  just  running  late 	0.25
and  dont  have  time  , 	0.25
but  in  that  three  weeks  I  have  used  it  at  least  5  days  out  of  every  week 	0.25
and  it  has  been  great  . 	0.25
This  thing  is  so  easy  to  use  right  out  of  the  box  with  the  pods  I  was  just  amased  , 	0.34375
my  old  machine  went  down  quite 	0.375
a  while  ago  so  I  havent  pulled  a  shot  in  a  very  long  time  and  with  this  machine 	0.25
I  was  sipping  a  great  one  in  minutes  ! 	0.25
The  one  thing 	0.0001
that  did  dissapoint 	0.0001
me  is  the  pods  , 	0.25
I  bought  the  machine 	0.0001
thinking  I  would  use  them 	0.0001
as  they  seemed  so  convient  .  .  . 	0.0001
and  dont  get 	0.0001
me  wrong  , 	0.0001
the  illy  dark  roast  pods  make  one  of  the  best  shots  of  espresso 	0.4375
I  have  ever  had  ,  very  quickly  , 	0.25
but  keep  in  mind 	0.125
they  only  make  one  shot  at  a  time  so  for  me 	0.0001
who  usually  likes  3  or  4  shots  in  a  cappucino 	0.125
they  are  a  bit  time  consuming 	0.25
and  I  have  found  it  better 	0.5625
to  just  pack  my  own  double  shots  . 	0.0001
But  besides  that  little  thing 	0.0001
this  machine  is  perfect  for  a  coffee  nut  like  me  , 	0.4375
it  does  a  great  job  no  matter 	0.125
what  im  in  the  mood  for  ,  be  it  a  straight  shot  ,  a  cappucino  ,  or  the  nice  mocha  latte  every  now 	0.5625
and  then  this  is  a  great  machine  for  you  , 	0.25
may  not  be  good  enough  for  a  coffee  snob  .  .  . 	0.375
but  just  right  for  a  coffee  nut  ! 	0.25
Oh  and  one  hint  I  found  very  helpfull  .  .  . 	0.25
turn  the  machine  on  5  or  10  minutes 	0.0001
before  you  are  going  to  use  it  -LRB-  the  longer  the  better  -RRB- 	0.5625
with  your  cups  up  on  the  warmer  . 	0.0001
I  saw  some  people  complaining  that  the  espresso  was  only  luke  warm 	0.25
when  it  came  out  , 	0.0001
I  exprenced  the  same  problem 	0.0001
when  I  dont  let  it  warm  up 	0.0001
and  brew  into  a  cold  cup  ,  but  if  you  do  let  it  warm  up  it  will  make 	0.25
you  a  nice 	0.875

Well  after  reading  the  reviews  of  this  vacuum  , 	0.125
I  decided  to  give  it  a  try  . 	0.0001
I  have  had  it  a  month  now  and  I  have  to  say 	0.25
that  I  am  sorry 	0.25
I  bought  this  behemoth  . 	0.0001
Right  out  of  the  box 	0.25
and  trying  it  for  the  first  time  I  noticed  things 	0.0001
that  I  did  n't  like  . 	0.125
I  thought  I  'd  give  it  some  time  though  and  hoped 	0.125
I  could  adjust  . 	0.125
Here  is  what  I  found  : 	0.25
1  .  The  vacuum  is  very  heavy 	0.25
as  other  reviewers  have  stated  . 	0.25
2  .  Worse  than  the  vacuum 	0.0001
being  heavy  , 	0.25
the  darn  thing  is  really  hard  to  push  . 	0.28125
Even  on  hard  smooth  surfaces 	0.125
it  's  hard  to  push  . 	0.0001
I  have  not  figured  out  yet  what  the  heck  would  cause  it  to  have  so  much  drag  . 	0.21875
For  it  to  drag  on  hard  surfaces  , 	0.0001
it  must  be  a  design  flaw  . 	0.25
3  .  The  on\/off  power  switch  is  foot 	0.25
operated  . 	0.0001
Not  a  terrible  thing 	0.0001
but  Dirt  Devil  decided  to  put  the  darn  thing  out  of  view 	0.125
and  hidden  by  the  accessory  carriage  . 	0.0001
On  my  first  time  of  vacuuming  I  accidentally  ran  over  a  sock 	0.125
and  it  got  caught  in  the  floor  brush  . 	0.125
While  the  brush  belt  was  smoking  I  fumbled  around  for  the  damn  power  switch  . 	0.1875
I  finally  had  to  reach  down 	0.25
and  press  the  switch  by  hand 	0.5
because  I  could  n't  find  it  by  looking  down  . 	0.0001
It  must  have  taking  me  eight  to  ten  seconds  to  finally  turn  the  thing  off  . 	0.25
Unfortunately  ,  the  damage  was  done  . 	0.25
The  belt  snapped  . 	0.0001
How  nice  . 	0.875
I  really  liked  that  . 	0.375
First  time  out  and  the  belt  snapped  . 	0.0001
Another  note  about  the  switch  ; 	0.0001
there  have  been  times 	0.3333333333333333
I  have  had  to  repeatedly  press  the  switch 	0.25
because  it  would  not  lock  off  . 	0.0001
It  takes  a  firm  steady  pressure 	0.0001
to  turn  it  off  . 	0.0001
The  fun  part  of  this  annoyance  is  that  you  think 	0.3125
you  have  it  turned  off 	0.25
because  the  motor  starts  winding  down 	0.0001
and  as  soon  as  you  let  up  on  it  the  motor  powers  up  . 	0.0001
Couple  that  with  not  being  able  to  really  see  the  darn  thing 	0.28125
it  's  a  real  challenge  . 	0.375
Maybe  Dirt  Devil  thinks  we  have  eyes  on  our  toes  . 	0.2916666666666667
Hey  Dirt  Devil  here  is  an  idea  . 	0.16666666666666666
How  about  putting  the  on\/off  switch  on  the  push  handle  . 	0.0001
What  a  novel  idea  . 	0.125
Doh  ! 	0.0001
4  .  The  vacuum  hose  that  detaches  is  really  unwieldy  . 	0.3333333333333333
It  has  a  long  plastic  handle 	0.25
that  you  hold  onto  and 	0.0001
that  makes  it  really  difficult  to  manipulate  the  hose  . 	0.625
The  main  reason  being  is  that  the  hose  it  too  short  . 	0.21875
It  's  like  you  are  fighting  the  hose  all  the  time  . 	0.25
It  gets 	0.125
tiring  . 	0.0001
5  . 	0.0001
The  detachable  hose  is  really  hard  to  re-install  in  it  's  port  . 	0.3125
You  have  to  wedge  it  in  there  really  hard  to  get  the  thing  to  seat  . 	0.28125
6  . 	0.0001
The  vacuum  is  terrible  on  rugs  ,  on  any  of  the  floor  height  settings  . 	0.25
It  bunches  up  the  rugs 	0.0001
and  starts  smoking  baby  . 	0.0001
My  old  vac  was  not  much  better 	0.40625
but  at  least  with  the  old  one 	0.375
I  could  lift  the  vac  and  kind  of  drag 	0.125
it  over  the  rug 	0.0001
and  it  would  n't  get  all 	0.125
caught  up  . 	0.0001
I  tried  the  same  thing  with  the  Dirt  Devil 	0.125
and  forget  about  it  . 	0.25
It  jammed  up  every  time  . 	0.0001
7  . 	0.0001
The  vacuum  is  poor  at  getting  dirt  off  of  hard  surface  floors  . 	0.1875
It  just  moves  the  dirt  around  or  spits  it  out  the  back  . 	0.0001
I  have  to  use  the  hose  attachment  . 	0.25
8  . 	0.0001
The  vacuum  is  horrible  on  steps  . 	0.25
With  my  old  vac 	0.375
I  could  drag  the  vac  across  each  step  whilst  the  vacuum  is  locked  in  the  upright  position  . 	0.25
