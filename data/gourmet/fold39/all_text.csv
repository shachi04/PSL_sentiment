19_gourmet_neg_1	I love salmon
19_gourmet_neg_2	and was very excited about having salmon jerky to keep at the office
19_gourmet_neg_3	and take
19_gourmet_neg_4	camping and skiing . . .
19_gourmet_neg_5	until I got my order
19_gourmet_neg_6	and found out that
19_gourmet_neg_7	both flavors contain MSG ,
19_gourmet_neg_8	which gives some people
19_gourmet_neg_9	-LRB- like me -RRB-
19_gourmet_neg_10	whopping headaches .
19_gourmet_neg_11	My wife thinks this jerky is okay apart from the processed texture
19_gourmet_neg_12	and our dogs love it ,
19_gourmet_neg_13	but I wo n't be trying it .
19_gourmet_neg_14	To be fair ,
19_gourmet_neg_15	you might like this product if you are n't sensitive to MSG ,
19_gourmet_neg_16	but the seller should have noted
19_gourmet_neg_17	that it contains a modern ingredient
19_gourmet_neg_18	"that causes adverse reactions in some people instead of describing it as being "" made the old fashioned way . """
19_gourmet_neg_19	On the plus side , shipping was very quick .
