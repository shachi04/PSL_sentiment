15_gourmet_pos_1	Try something different .
15_gourmet_pos_2	Forget microwave popcorn for a few weeks and try this four-pack just once .
15_gourmet_pos_3	At the very least ,
15_gourmet_pos_4	you ` ll have a new food experience ,
15_gourmet_pos_5	but what you might get is a new family tradition .
15_gourmet_pos_6	It 's worth it .
15_gourmet_pos_7	My wife and I received a four-pack of Fireworks Popcorn last year with these four flavors ,
15_gourmet_pos_8	and because we are huge fans of stovetop-popping popcorn ,
15_gourmet_pos_9	it was a definite treat .
15_gourmet_pos_10	We love
15_gourmet_pos_11	watching movies ,
15_gourmet_pos_12	and it 's a weekend tradition to make a giant tub of popcorn and jump on the couch .
15_gourmet_pos_13	This 4-pack is a fantastic way to discover the differences in types of popcorn ,
15_gourmet_pos_14	and there really are subtle differences .
15_gourmet_pos_15	There is a description of the flavor on each bottle , and the bottles also tell you about the size and robustness of the finished product .
15_gourmet_pos_16	As gourmet as any other gourmet popcorn I ` ve ever tried ,
15_gourmet_pos_17	the kernels pop up nice and big and almost every kernel pops .
15_gourmet_pos_18	The flavors augment a good low-fat butter spray if that 's your fancy .
15_gourmet_pos_19	I 'm very much looking forward to receiving the 8-flavor sampler !
15_gourmet_pos_20	Personally ,
15_gourmet_pos_21	I pop mine in olive oil with a few dashes of garlic-infused oil and\/or the red spicy olive oil and a little salt .
15_gourmet_pos_22	That is something
15_gourmet_pos_23	you ca n't do in a microwave !
15_gourmet_pos_24	If you ` ve never popped popcorn on a stove
15_gourmet_pos_25	before
15_gourmet_pos_26	and you ` re intimidated . . .
15_gourmet_pos_27	no worries .
15_gourmet_pos_28	Pour in enough popcorn to cover the bottom of the pot ,
15_gourmet_pos_29	add enough olive oil cover up about half the height of the kernels , shake it over the heat until the popping almost stops ,
15_gourmet_pos_30	and pour out the popcorn into a bowl asap .
15_gourmet_pos_31	Practice makes perfect ,
15_gourmet_pos_32	and you do n't need much practice at all . . .
15_gourmet_pos_33	maybe just one try !
15_gourmet_pos_34	Honestly , for the labor of about 90 seconds on the stove and one pot to wash ,
15_gourmet_pos_35	you turn an evening of TV-viewing or movie watching into an event .
15_gourmet_pos_36	The kids will love it ,
15_gourmet_pos_37	and as a grown-up kid ,
15_gourmet_pos_38	I highly recommend it .
15_gourmet_pos_39	I have fond memories
15_gourmet_pos_40	of my dad
15_gourmet_pos_41	making popcorn for the three kids on Saturday nights ,
15_gourmet_pos_42	and this is a good product to make those memories
