20_gourmet_pos_1	Rings-Ding 's are the best snacks out there for many a reasons .
20_gourmet_pos_2	First off ,
20_gourmet_pos_3	they are the best after dinner snacks out there .
20_gourmet_pos_4	It 's really like a cake , just more condensed and not as fatty or filling .
20_gourmet_pos_5	Also , these things are addicting .
20_gourmet_pos_6	In my life ,
20_gourmet_pos_7	I can not even count how much packs
20_gourmet_pos_8	I have consumed ,
20_gourmet_pos_9	since I have been eating these things everyday
20_gourmet_pos_10	since I was young ,
20_gourmet_pos_11	and let 's just say
20_gourmet_pos_12	now I am very old .
20_gourmet_pos_13	If you can not afford drugs ,
20_gourmet_pos_14	then go for the ring-ding 's .
20_gourmet_pos_15	The only negative about these things if there is n't enough cream ,
20_gourmet_pos_16	then you get a mouthful of chocolate .
20_gourmet_pos_17	Most people I know like the chocolate ,
20_gourmet_pos_18	but I personally would not like a mouthful of it .
20_gourmet_pos_19	Another bad thing is in the summer ,
20_gourmet_pos_20	they are melted and can only be slightly revived if refrigerated .
20_gourmet_pos_21	They kind of lose that good flavor edge in the summer ,
20_gourmet_pos_22	which makes this the perfect snack for the winter .
20_gourmet_pos_23	Alright . . .
20_gourmet_pos_24	the anatomy of a ring-ding
20_gourmet_pos_25	-LRB- DUN-DUN-DUN -RRB- .
20_gourmet_pos_26	First off ,
20_gourmet_pos_27	you get a chocolatey outside
20_gourmet_pos_28	that is pretty soft .
20_gourmet_pos_29	In the center is a creamy sensation
20_gourmet_pos_30	-LRB- sorry if that sounded dirty . . . get your mind out of the gutter -RRB-
20_gourmet_pos_31	that
20_gourmet_pos_32	really makes this product go from good to great .
20_gourmet_pos_33	Put that together
20_gourmet_pos_34	and you get probably the best snack out there right now .
20_gourmet_pos_35	They come two in a pack
20_gourmet_pos_36	and are made by Drake 's .
20_gourmet_pos_37	Usually , Drake 's is in the shadow of Hostess ,
20_gourmet_pos_38	yet I feel Drake 's destroys Hostess in terms of their cakes .
20_gourmet_pos_39	If you are actually reading this , please do n't destroy me for saying
20_gourmet_pos_40	that Ring-Ding 's totally annihilates anything Hostess has ever put out .
20_gourmet_pos_41	Wow . . .
20_gourmet_pos_42	I managed to make a food product two paragraphs long
20_gourmet_pos_43	-LRB- two short paragraphs I should say -RRB- .
20_gourmet_pos_44	I would put the whole history of the Ring-Ding in ,
20_gourmet_pos_45	but that would probably be taking someone else 's work .
20_gourmet_pos_46	I guess I ` ll stop now .
20_gourmet_pos_47	Anyway , Ring-Ding 's for the win ! !
