19_cell_pos_1	So I bought this thing
19_cell_pos_2	based on the Amazon reviews
19_cell_pos_3	and saved a bundle over the local retail cost
19_cell_pos_4	-LRB- yeah Amazon ! -RRB- ,
19_cell_pos_5	but that 's not
19_cell_pos_6	why I 'm writing this review .
19_cell_pos_7	I 'd like to talk about the performance and comfort of the Earboom .
19_cell_pos_8	The eargel thingies are designed quite well , of the three different sizes for each ear
19_cell_pos_9	you ` re bound to find one
19_cell_pos_10	that fits very comfortably .
19_cell_pos_11	Turns out I could n't find any
19_cell_pos_12	that fit my right ear comfortably for extended periods of use
19_cell_pos_13	but found a perfect fit in my mate on the other side .
19_cell_pos_14	My wife had the exact opposite experience - hopefully our daughter will inherit more symmetrical ears !
19_cell_pos_15	I hate jogging so ca n't comment on the fit during that activity
19_cell_pos_16	but can say the gels fit
19_cell_pos_17	suprising well in the folds of your ear
19_cell_pos_18	and the boom is quite secure
19_cell_pos_19	when installed .
19_cell_pos_20	I 'd have to imagine
19_cell_pos_21	it 'd take a big hit
19_cell_pos_22	to knock it loose once in place .
19_cell_pos_23	Sound quality from the earbud is decent ,
19_cell_pos_24	but I feel
19_cell_pos_25	the Earboom lacks some fidelity , especially the higher frequencies .
19_cell_pos_26	Normally this is not a problem ,
19_cell_pos_27	but it can sometimes make the person
19_cell_pos_28	you ` re talking to sound like Isaac Hayes .
19_cell_pos_29	The speaker is plently loud and the lack of high frequencies allows you to tune into the tonal range
19_cell_pos_30	where us humans tend to converse ,
19_cell_pos_31	without having the voices
19_cell_pos_32	washed over with background noise .
19_cell_pos_33	The gels block an appropriate amount of external sounds
19_cell_pos_34	allowing you to concentrate on the discussion at hand without impeding your ability
19_cell_pos_35	to hear say
19_cell_pos_36	an ambulance while driving .
19_cell_pos_37	There is a small slot on the gels
19_cell_pos_38	that funnels some external noise to your drum ,
19_cell_pos_39	while the rest of the gel fits snug to the ear
19_cell_pos_40	blocking out other stray noise paths .
19_cell_pos_41	I ` ve asked people
19_cell_pos_42	how I sound
19_cell_pos_43	and thus far the feedback has been positive ,
19_cell_pos_44	my voice comes through loud and clear despite the boom 's apparent lack of length ,
19_cell_pos_45	reinforcing my belief
19_cell_pos_46	that size DOES N'T matter .
19_cell_pos_47	In fact ,
19_cell_pos_48	I have found the mic to be very sensitive to even small sounds .
19_cell_pos_49	Forget talking on the phone
19_cell_pos_50	and subtly typing on the keyboard our mouse click surfing -
19_cell_pos_51	they ` ll hear every click .
19_cell_pos_52	Another example ,
19_cell_pos_53	I was in my house
19_cell_pos_54	and the person on the other end could hear the kids
19_cell_pos_55	playing in the pool 40 feet away
19_cell_pos_56	with the house windows closed ! !
19_cell_pos_57	Yes , the mic is that sensitive .
19_cell_pos_58	Even while driving they could hear
19_cell_pos_59	when I shifted gears .
19_cell_pos_60	Not that it 's obtrusive to the other person on the phone ,
19_cell_pos_61	it 's just good to be aware
19_cell_pos_62	they can hear it all .
19_cell_pos_63	What more to say about such a simple device .
19_cell_pos_64	Form Fit and Function are all there and I would recommend this product .
19_cell_pos_65	In fact ,
19_cell_pos_66	I just ordered another -
19_cell_pos_67	it makes a great gift
