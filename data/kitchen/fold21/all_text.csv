1_kitchen_neg_1	Within a few weeks of purchase
1_kitchen_neg_2	the teflon in the Zojirushi pan started to blister and flake off .
1_kitchen_neg_3	This is NOT the result of customer abuse but a manufacturing defect .
1_kitchen_neg_4	This is my third -LRB- and final -RRB-
1_kitchen_neg_5	bread machine .
1_kitchen_neg_6	The first two were Breadman Ultimates .
1_kitchen_neg_7	I should note that I make bread in the machine about 6 times a week on average , pretty much every morning .
1_kitchen_neg_8	The first Breadman worked for over a year until the teflon in the pan started to fail .
1_kitchen_neg_9	This was probably my fault for allowing the pan
1_kitchen_neg_10	to soak for extended periods of time
1_kitchen_neg_11	-LRB- water can get behind the teflon
1_kitchen_neg_12	and ruin the bond -RRB- .
1_kitchen_neg_13	I bought an new Breadman Ultimate
1_kitchen_neg_14	because the entire machine was only slightly more than the pan alone and the old machine was starting to have mechanical problems .
1_kitchen_neg_15	This time I took extremely good care of the pan
1_kitchen_neg_16	-LRB- letting it cool down , no soaking -RRB-
1_kitchen_neg_17	because it 's clearly the weak link in the system .
1_kitchen_neg_18	Within 8 months the stirring shaft that drives the paddle in the pan simply fell out .
1_kitchen_neg_19	Whatever the detente mechanism was that holds the shaft to the pan failed ,
1_kitchen_neg_20	making the machine useless .
1_kitchen_neg_21	Currently it does n't seem very easy
1_kitchen_neg_22	-LRB- or even possible -RRB-
1_kitchen_neg_23	to buy a replacement pan for the Breadman .
1_kitchen_neg_24	At this point I was done with the Breadman .
1_kitchen_neg_25	Much as I did n't want to spring for the extra money for the Zojirushi ,
1_kitchen_neg_26	and realizing
1_kitchen_neg_27	that my default augmented
1_kitchen_neg_28	sourdough recipe probably would n't work the same in the new machine ,
1_kitchen_neg_29	I did n't see an alternative
1_kitchen_neg_30	and got one .
1_kitchen_neg_31	Within 3 weeks the teflon in the Zoji pan formed two blisters .
1_kitchen_neg_32	One is bit
1_kitchen_neg_33	smaller than a dime and all the teflon at this spot has flaked off ;
1_kitchen_neg_34	the other spot is blistering
1_kitchen_neg_35	but the teflon is still intact .
1_kitchen_neg_36	I have been extremely careful with the pan :
1_kitchen_neg_37	I wait
1_kitchen_neg_38	for it to cool and then remove the baked-on bread under the paddles with warm water using mostly my fingers .
1_kitchen_neg_39	I do n't let it soak at all .
1_kitchen_neg_40	This is clearly a manufacturing defect .
1_kitchen_neg_41	I have further complaints with respect to this machine as compared to the Breadman Ultimate :
1_kitchen_neg_42	1 -RRB- The top of the bread rarely gets brown .
1_kitchen_neg_43	I ` ve added more sugar to the recipe
1_kitchen_neg_44	which helps slightly
1_kitchen_neg_45	but not much .
1_kitchen_neg_46	2 -RRB- I do n't understand what the crust control option does .
1_kitchen_neg_47	It does n't seem to increase baking time
1_kitchen_neg_48	which it does on the Breadman so it does n't make much sense .
1_kitchen_neg_49	3 -RRB- The programmability is very weak .
1_kitchen_neg_50	On the Breadman
1_kitchen_neg_51	you can take any of the existing standard options
1_kitchen_neg_52	and modify them as well as make up entirely new programs .
1_kitchen_neg_53	4 -RRB- The programmability options are very limited :
1_kitchen_neg_54	- You ca n't control the knockdown time between risings .
1_kitchen_neg_55	- You ca n't add risings to the default three .
1_kitchen_neg_56	They do give you a lot of time control on the risings .
1_kitchen_neg_57	- You ca n't separate the mixing cycle from the kneading cycle :
1_kitchen_neg_58	it 's all one cycle .
1_kitchen_neg_59	-
1_kitchen_neg_60	When you turn off the preheat cycle ,
1_kitchen_neg_61	this only affects the built-in programs and not the custom ones .
1_kitchen_neg_62	- And worst of all :
1_kitchen_neg_63	you
1_kitchen_neg_64	ca n't bake for more than 70 minutes .
1_kitchen_neg_65	This is utterly ridiculous .
1_kitchen_neg_66	"I 'm sure this is a "" safety feature """
1_kitchen_neg_67	but it means
1_kitchen_neg_68	you ca n't correct for the pathetic lack of crust formation or have larger recipes
1_kitchen_neg_69	and so forth .
1_kitchen_neg_70	This is almost a killer limitation in my opinion .
1_kitchen_neg_71	For those other reviewers
1_kitchen_neg_72	that are having issues with rising ,
1_kitchen_neg_73	I ` ve determined
1_kitchen_neg_74	that the machine is very sensitive to the amount , type , and quality of yeast .
1_kitchen_neg_75	If you \* exactly \* follow the manufacturers instuctions with respect
1_kitchen_neg_76	to yeast and use fresh yeast ,
1_kitchen_neg_77	it should work okay .
1_kitchen_neg_78	This means you must use rapid rise yeast with the Quick programs
1_kitchen_neg_79	and active dry yeast with the longer standard programs .
1_kitchen_neg_80	Even using Fleischmann 's instead of Red Star made a difference .
1_kitchen_neg_81	The Breadman was pretty much indifferent to yeast variations .
1_kitchen_neg_82	At this point I 'm
1_kitchen_neg_83	done with bread machines .
1_kitchen_neg_84	They are a failed technology .
1_kitchen_neg_85	In fact , teflon is a dangerous and substandard technology .
1_kitchen_neg_86	All you have to do is search for teflon
1_kitchen_neg_87	-LRB- Polytetrafluoroethylene -RRB-
1_kitchen_neg_88	and toxic to come up with some pretty alarming data on this noxious substance .
1_kitchen_neg_89	The manufacturing process results in significant environmental contamination .
1_kitchen_neg_90	A direct consumer health risk due to toxic outgassing occurs
1_kitchen_neg_91	when teflon is exposed to temperatures above 500 degrees
1_kitchen_neg_92	-LRB- eg :
1_kitchen_neg_93	frying pans -RRB- .
1_kitchen_neg_94	Perhaps bread machines are not that risky
1_kitchen_neg_95	given the lower temps
1_kitchen_neg_96	involved in baking and the fact
1_kitchen_neg_97	that wet dough will keep the average pan temperature pretty low , but if you know anything about toxicity
1_kitchen_neg_98	you will realize that it is always a sliding scale :
1_kitchen_neg_99	there will be some outgassing at lower temperatures .
1_kitchen_neg_100	Imagine low levels of toxic gas
1_kitchen_neg_101	released into your homemade bread .
1_kitchen_neg_102	I ` ve thought about this ,
1_kitchen_neg_103	but there 's no way to make a bread machine without teflon --
1_kitchen_neg_104	going from mixing dough to baking requires teflon ,
1_kitchen_neg_105	there is just no other viable solution .
1_kitchen_neg_106	I love
1_kitchen_neg_107	making bread every day
1_kitchen_neg_108	and I 'm going to miss this activity
1_kitchen_neg_109	but at this point the manufacturing defects and use of teflon mean
1_kitchen_neg_110	I have to give up on this technology .
1_kitchen_neg_111	It 's back to the occasional hand-made loaf --
1_kitchen_neg_112	it 's the only rational and healthy solution
