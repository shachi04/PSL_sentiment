11_gourmet_neg_1	I know of many people
11_gourmet_neg_2	who would love to have an elk carcass for their holiday .
11_gourmet_neg_3	Birthdays , Christmas , Hanukkah , Martin Luther King Jr. ' s Birthday Observed , Grandparent 's Day , etc . are all holidays
11_gourmet_neg_4	where a big piece of elk meat could brighten someone 's day .
11_gourmet_neg_5	But watch out ! ! !
11_gourmet_neg_6	I have often used Amazon in order to buy gifts ,
11_gourmet_neg_7	and with this elk carcass GIFT WRAPPING IS NOT AN OPTION .
11_gourmet_neg_8	I would think
11_gourmet_neg_9	that half the fun of giving a huge elk carcass would be watching the look
11_gourmet_neg_10	on your loved one 's face as he or she unwrapped the slab of meat .
11_gourmet_neg_11	Unfortunately , Amazon does not think
11_gourmet_neg_12	this is so .
11_gourmet_neg_13	With the weight of the product ,
11_gourmet_neg_14	I think
11_gourmet_neg_15	it is going to be difficult to wrap this on my own .
11_gourmet_neg_16	Sorry Uncle Tino , no elk carcass for Columbus Day this year !
