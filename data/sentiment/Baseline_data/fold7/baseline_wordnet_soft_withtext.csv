 1_gourmet_neg_25	negative	0.0001	0.25	I  have  ever  used  in  my  Senseo  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_26	negative	0.0001	0.0001	The  instructions  for  the  Kona  pods  say 
 1_gourmet_neg_27	negative	0.125	0.25	to  wiggle  the  pods  to  break  up  the  coffee  before  inserting  into  the  machine  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_28	negative	0.20833333333333334	0.16666666666666666	The  Kona  pods  feel  very  hard 
 1_gourmet_neg_29	negative	0.0001	0.0001	when  taken  out  of  their  package  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_30	negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  always  wiggled  and  jiggled  the  pods  for  about  10  seconds 
 1_gourmet_neg_31	negative	0.0001	0.0001	before  putting  them  in  the  Senseo  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_32	negative	0.625	0.0001	After  my  problems  with  the  Kona  pods  , 
 1_gourmet_neg_33	negative	0.375	0.25	my  husband  decided  that  I  was  not  '  wiggling  ' 
 1_gourmet_neg_34	negative	0.0001	0.125	them  enough  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_35	negative	0.25	0.25	He  promptly  wiggled  one  to  the  point  that  it  broke  open  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_36	negative	0.0001	0.0001	So  , 
 1_gourmet_neg_37	negative	0.125	0.1875	there  is  just  so  much 
 1_gourmet_neg_38	negative	0.125	0.25	that  can  be  done  to  the  pod 
 1_gourmet_neg_39	negative	0.0001	0.0001	before  putting  it  in  the  machine  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_40	negative	0.125	0.25	The  first  thing  that  I  noticed  was  that  the  amount  of  coffee 
 1_gourmet_neg_41	negative	0.0001	0.0001	brewed 
 1_gourmet_neg_42	negative	0.3125	0.25	when  using  the  Kona  pod  was  quite  a  bit  less  than  when  using  2  smaller  pods  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_43	negative	0.625	0.375	That  did  not  make  much  sense  , 
 1_gourmet_neg_44	negative	0.0001	0.0001	but  after  several  cups  of  Kona  , 
 1_gourmet_neg_45	negative	0.125	0.375	it  was  obvious 
 1_gourmet_neg_46	negative	0.375	0.25	that  there  was  never  the  amount  of  coffee 
 1_gourmet_neg_47	negative	0.375	0.0001	coming  out  as  before  when  using  2  small  one  cup  pods  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_48	negative	0.125	0.5	The  best  I  can  figure  out  is  that  the  Kona  pods 
 1_gourmet_neg_49	negative	0.0001	0.0001	themselves  seem  to  '  hold  '  a  lot  more  water  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_50	negative	0.125	0.25	There  is  more  water 
 1_gourmet_neg_51	negative	0.0001	0.0001	that  remains  in  the  pod  itself 
 1_gourmet_neg_52	negative	0.125	0.25	after  the  brewing  is  done  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_53	negative	0.125	0.25	The  pod  itself  is  heavier

 1_gourmet_neg_56	negative	0.0001	0.0001	So  , 
 1_gourmet_neg_57	negative	0.0001	0.125	I  believe 
 1_gourmet_neg_58	negative	0.0001	0.0001	the  reason 
 1_gourmet_neg_59	negative	0.3125	0.20833333333333334	that  there  is  less  actual  coffee  using  Kona  pods  is  that  the  pods  themselves  retain  a  lot  more  water 
 1_gourmet_neg_60	negative	0.625	0.0001	and  it  can  not  pass  through  into  the  coffee  cup  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_61	negative	0.0001	0.0001	Then  , 
 1_gourmet_neg_62	negative	0.0001	0.25	as  others  have  mentioned  , 
 1_gourmet_neg_63	negative	0.375	0.25	there  is  the  problem 
 1_gourmet_neg_64	negative	0.0001	0.0001	that  happens  to  me  about  1\/2  the  time 
 1_gourmet_neg_65	negative	0.0001	0.0001	when  using  the  Kona  pods  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_66	negative	0.375	0.25	The  problem  is  that  for  whatever  reason  , 
 1_gourmet_neg_67	negative	0.625	0.375	the  water  does  not  actually  go  through 
 1_gourmet_neg_68	negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  penetrate  the  Kona  pods  during  the  brewing  cycle  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_69	negative	0.0001	0.0001	The  '  coffee  ' 
 1_gourmet_neg_70	negative	0.125	0.25	that  is  supposed  to  be  coming  out  of  the  spout  is  just  water  ! 
 1_gourmet_neg_71	negative	0.375	0.4375	This  problem  is  one  that  I  still  can  not  really  figure  out  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_72	negative	0.375	0.25	The  Kona  pods  are  a  little  smaller  in  diameter  than  all  the  other  pods 
 1_gourmet_neg_73	negative	0.0001	0.25	I  have  tried  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_74	negative	0.0001	0.0001	So  , 
 1_gourmet_neg_75	negative	0.5	0.15625	I  guess  that  somehow  the  water  has  enough  room  to  '  go  around  '  the  actual  pod 
 1_gourmet_neg_76	negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  come  out  of  the  spout  without  '  going  through  '  the  pod 
 1_gourmet_neg_77	negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  brew  coffee  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_78	negative	0.375	0.4375	I  also  wonder  if  the  paper  filter  of  the  Kona  pods  is  different  than  other  pods 
 1_gourmet_neg_79	negative	0.4375	0.25	and  for  some  reason  the  Kona  paper  is  more  difficult  for  water 
 1_gourmet_neg_80	negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  penetrate  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_81	negative	0.0001	0.25	I  have  tried 
 1_gourmet_neg_82	negative	0.0001	0.25	wetting  the  Kona  pod  paper  filter  right  before  starting  to  brew  the  coffee 
 1_gourmet_neg_83	negative	0.0001	0.0001	thinking  that  perhaps  it  would  help  the  water 
 1_gourmet_neg_84	negative	0.0001	0.0001	to  penetrate  the  paper  and  pod  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_85	negative	0.625	0.25	But  ,  that  has  not  worked  for  me  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_86	negative	0.0001	0.0001	So  , 
 1_gourmet_neg_87	negative	0.1875	0.1875	it  is  back  to  regular  more  reasonably  priced  coffee  pods  for  me  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_88	negative	0.25	0.225	I  have  wasted  too  many  expensive  Kona  pods  trying  to  get  a  proper  cup  of  coffee  from  them  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_89	negative	0.0001	0.125	Even  when  the  Kona  pods  brew  a  cup  of  coffee  , 
 1_gourmet_neg_90	negative	0.2916666666666667	0.20833333333333334	it  is  not  as  large  of  an  amount  of  coffee  as  I  get 
 1_gourmet_neg_91	negative	0.625	0.0001	using  other  brands  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_92	negative	0.0001	0.0001	So  , 
 1_gourmet_neg_93	negative	0.0001	0.0001	adding  the  cost  of  the  Kona  pods  to  the  fact 
 1_gourmet_neg_94	negative	0.375	0.0001	that  it  brews  a  smaller  amount  of  coffee  equals  a  product 
 1_gourmet_neg_95	negative	0.1875	0.2916666666666667	that  is  way  too  expensive 
 1_gourmet_neg_96	negative	0.0001	0.375	when  it  does  actually  work  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_97	negative	0.125	0.25	I  have  been  reading  of  a  product 
 1_gourmet_neg_98	negative	0.0001	0.25	called  an  EcoPod  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_99	negative	0.125	0.25	It  is  a  refillable  pod  for  these  type  of  coffeemakers  . 
 1_gourmet_neg_100	negative	0.125	0.25	It  might  be  the  next  thing 
 1_gourmet_neg_101	negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  try  .
