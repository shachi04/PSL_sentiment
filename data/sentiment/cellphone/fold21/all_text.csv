1_cell_neg_1	In summary , Microsoft 's software and T-Mobile 's service have ruined a brilliant design -LRB- although with a couple of flaws -RRB-
1_cell_neg_2	from HTC .
1_cell_neg_3	There are many pros and cons about this device and the service that it is shackled to .
1_cell_neg_4	I will break it down to Hardware , Software and Cell Phone Service Provider .
1_cell_neg_5	Hardware Pro 's :
1_cell_neg_6	A lot has been written about this aspect of the device , so I ` ll keep this to a minimum - The best form factor
1_cell_neg_7	I ` ve ever seen .
1_cell_neg_8	This device provides you the power of a Blackberry without the bulky hardware
1_cell_neg_9	so I can put it in my pocket comfortably
1_cell_neg_10	and not have to look like a geek with the belt holster .
1_cell_neg_11	- A key selling point for me was the combined Bluetooth , Wi-Fi and quad-band connectivity
1_cell_neg_12	that enabled me to connect a wireless headset , cruise web pages
1_cell_neg_13	and have access
1_cell_neg_14	to email
1_cell_neg_15	when in the US or Europe .
1_cell_neg_16	- The phone quality is excellent .
1_cell_neg_17	- The keyboard layout is excellent and easy to use for medium sized emails .
1_cell_neg_18	- The battery life is great
1_cell_neg_19	when Wi-Fi is not enabled and adequate
1_cell_neg_20	when it is .
1_cell_neg_21	-LRB- I ` ve rarely struggled with a dying battery . -RRB- Stand-by
1_cell_neg_22	power management appears to be excellent .
1_cell_neg_23	- Charging of the device is very quick .
1_cell_neg_24	- The display ,
1_cell_neg_25	while a little small ,
1_cell_neg_26	is crystal clear and surprisingly easy to use given its size .
1_cell_neg_27	- The camera is pretty good and it 's been really great
1_cell_neg_28	emailing photo 's to people as I 'm traveling around .
1_cell_neg_29	After all of the cons
1_cell_neg_30	that you ` ll read below you
1_cell_neg_31	` ll wonder
1_cell_neg_32	why I ever bought the device
1_cell_neg_33	and why I still use it .
1_cell_neg_34	Well here it is :
1_cell_neg_35	1 . T-Mobile locked me into a 2 year contract on a very expensive device .
1_cell_neg_36	2 . It has great hardware
1_cell_neg_37	that I can use in the US and Europe ,
1_cell_neg_38	I 'm just hoping
1_cell_neg_39	that Microsoft will finally get
1_cell_neg_40	it right .
1_cell_neg_41	Hardware Con 's
1_cell_neg_42	- The touch sensitive volume button is the most ill-conceived feature
1_cell_neg_43	I ` ve ever seen .
1_cell_neg_44	Even after playing around with various settings
1_cell_neg_45	it is still hard to quickly set the volume at the desired level .
1_cell_neg_46	Even worse ,
1_cell_neg_47	when using the phone your ear or finger can inadvertently hit the control
1_cell_neg_48	and randomly change the volume .
1_cell_neg_49	- The TI OMAP 850 at 201MHz is not beefy enough for the software
1_cell_neg_50	that is loaded onto the device .
1_cell_neg_51	However ,
1_cell_neg_52	the blame could well be laid at Microsoft 's door for writing inefficient code
1_cell_neg_53	and having poor scheduling software between tasks and applications .
1_cell_neg_54	Either way , performance is very slow for some basic functions
1_cell_neg_55	-LRB- see below -RRB-
1_cell_neg_56	and
1_cell_neg_57	I 'm afraid
1_cell_neg_58	some of the blame needs to be laid at the choice of processor .
1_cell_neg_59	Software Pro 's
1_cell_neg_60	- Not many
1_cell_neg_61	that really come to mind .
1_cell_neg_62	Software Con 's
1_cell_neg_63	-LRB- I hope
1_cell_neg_64	you ` re sitting comfortably -RRB-
1_cell_neg_65	-
1_cell_neg_66	When a call is on call
1_cell_neg_67	waiting the phone fails to give an option to the user to select which call to take and
1_cell_neg_68	which call to put on hold or drop\/ignore .
1_cell_neg_69	On the occasions
1_cell_neg_70	this problem has occurred with me the call
1_cell_neg_71	that is dropped\/kept appears random with a preference to switch to the incoming call no matter
1_cell_neg_72	what is depressed .
1_cell_neg_73	The other call is dropped and not put on hold .
1_cell_neg_74	-
1_cell_neg_75	When a call is incoming
1_cell_neg_76	and the keyboard is locked ,
1_cell_neg_77	if the user depresses the green phone key the call is dropped .
1_cell_neg_78	This is extremely counter intuitive .
1_cell_neg_79	"If the user presses anything other than the "" answer "" key the call is dropped and sometimes the call has been dropped even"
1_cell_neg_80	"when I have depressed the "" answer "" key ."
1_cell_neg_81	- The contacts database is extremely rudimentary with a very limited number of views and filters
1_cell_neg_82	that can be used .
1_cell_neg_83	Even worse , upon selection , the contacts database takes between 5 and 8 seconds
1_cell_neg_84	to open .
1_cell_neg_85	Now ,
1_cell_neg_86	I have what some would call a large database of contacts ,
1_cell_neg_87	but considering
1_cell_neg_88	that the Palm OS version responded immediately with a far more sophisticated use model this excuse does not wash .
1_cell_neg_89	It 's simply a poorly architected database .
1_cell_neg_90	- The user interface for entering a new contact is rudimentary
1_cell_neg_91	-LRB- as are all dialog windows on this device . -RRB-
1_cell_neg_92	- One of the most annoying aspects of this device is the alarm clock .
1_cell_neg_93	The user interface looks like it was written in 10 minutes
1_cell_neg_94	and was clearly not verified for correctness .
1_cell_neg_95	The digital watch I had in 1982 had the same degree of sophistication
1_cell_neg_96	but with a more intuitive use model
1_cell_neg_97	and was more thoroughly debugged .
1_cell_neg_98	First of all , the user only gets to select a time and if the alarm is on or off .
1_cell_neg_99	From the interface
1_cell_neg_100	you would assume you could only set a single alarm . . .
1_cell_neg_101	if only it were that obvious .
1_cell_neg_102	The best way to explain this buggy piece of software is with an example :
1_cell_neg_103	I set the alarm for 6am ;
1_cell_neg_104	the next day the alarm goes off at 6am .
1_cell_neg_105	That day I set the alarm for 7am -
1_cell_neg_106	the following day the alarm goes off at 6am and 7am .
1_cell_neg_107	The next day I set the alarm for 7:30 am and you guessed it ,
1_cell_neg_108	the alarm now goes off three times .
1_cell_neg_109	The best that I ` ve been able to deduce
1_cell_neg_110	-LRB- of course , this type of behavior
1_cell_neg_111	is not documented in the user manual
1_cell_neg_112	that comes with the device -RRB-
1_cell_neg_113	"is that the user has to actively select "" off "" for the current setting"
1_cell_neg_114	"before setting "" on "" for the new time ."
1_cell_neg_115	But there is no indication of what alarms are set , so after a while or a particularly busy week you can loose track of what 's set and what is n't . . . the only way to clear all of the alarms
1_cell_neg_116	that have been set is a hard re-boot .
1_cell_neg_117	- The calculator is a joke .
1_cell_neg_118	If this took an engineer 10 minutes to write they should be fired .
1_cell_neg_119	A calculator watch in the ' 80 's had more sophisticated features .
1_cell_neg_120	The user interface is so bad
1_cell_neg_121	it 's hard to describe it in words .
1_cell_neg_122	- Microsoft truly does not understand
1_cell_neg_123	how a user would like to use the device
1_cell_neg_124	and instead insists on using the same usage model
1_cell_neg_125	that they ` ve inflicted upon us since Windows 95 .
1_cell_neg_126	Most features or function have to be navigated through the Start menu button .
1_cell_neg_127	Applications are nested and features are hidden behind several annoying menu selections .
1_cell_neg_128	Some features are simply hard to find ,
1_cell_neg_129	but should it really take so many menu selections
1_cell_neg_130	to find common tools or applications ?
1_cell_neg_131	- The use of alarms or reminders is ambiguous -
1_cell_neg_132	"to put the device in "" Silent "" mode ,"
1_cell_neg_133	but leave alarms on
1_cell_neg_134	because you want to sleep and only want your alarm to wake
1_cell_neg_135	you
1_cell_neg_136	up , for example ,
1_cell_neg_137	does not work .
1_cell_neg_138	Calendar reminders will be active
1_cell_neg_139	as they are assigned the alarm property instead of their own or the notification property .
1_cell_neg_140	The only way around this is to cancel reminders for all day events . . .
1_cell_neg_141	otherwise
1_cell_neg_142	you get an alarm at midnight .
1_cell_neg_143	- So ,
1_cell_neg_144	on my Nokia phone a thousand years ago ,
1_cell_neg_145	when I went to Europe my phone would have a simple selection for the new frequency
1_cell_neg_146	I needed
1_cell_neg_147	once landed .
1_cell_neg_148	The phone would then automatically connect to the provider available .
1_cell_neg_149	It was n't completely automatic ,
1_cell_neg_150	but the user interaction was simple and intuitive .
1_cell_neg_151	Not with the Dash .
1_cell_neg_152	First of all T-Mobile does n't help by keeping a radio button on your online account that you have to select to enable international roaming .
1_cell_neg_153	The feature is free
1_cell_neg_154	so why not add a selection anyway ?
1_cell_neg_155	All you know
1_cell_neg_156	when you get to your destination is that your phone wo n't connect to the local network no matter
1_cell_neg_157	what you do .
1_cell_neg_158	Now ,
1_cell_neg_159	assuming
1_cell_neg_160	that you worked this out ,
1_cell_neg_161	you are now faced with the challenge of actually connecting to the local provider 's network .
1_cell_neg_162	On my Blackberry this was automatic ,
1_cell_neg_163	but of course with Microsoft
1_cell_neg_164	there are selections to make , searches to activate and various other contortions
1_cell_neg_165	that need to be gone through before you connect to the provider of choice .
1_cell_neg_166	Assuming that you get
1_cell_neg_167	connected at all .
1_cell_neg_168	- ActiveSync :
1_cell_neg_169	This is the most annoying piece of software in that it just does not work .
1_cell_neg_170	Worse still ,
1_cell_neg_171	when it does not work it gives a cryptic error message
1_cell_neg_172	stating that an error has occurred and some data will be lost next time you perform synchronization .
1_cell_neg_173	It does not provide you with a fix , a hint or a path so that you do n't lose data .
1_cell_neg_174	It does not even tell you the data
1_cell_neg_175	that was lost .
1_cell_neg_176	So ,
1_cell_neg_177	I 'm using a Microsoft Mobile OS with Microsoft XP and Microsoft Outlook
1_cell_neg_178	and they ca n't get that right ?
1_cell_neg_179	-LRB- OK ,
1_cell_neg_180	it maybe serves me right for signing up to so much Microsoft ,
1_cell_neg_181	but come on . -RRB-
1_cell_neg_182	This was another primary purchasing driver for me .
1_cell_neg_183	I am very busy and want to have my schedule up to date between my PC and PDA - all the time .
1_cell_neg_184	It 's the only way to keep organized .
1_cell_neg_185	I thought that with the same provider of all the software
1_cell_neg_186	I 'd be OK .
1_cell_neg_187	Also ,
1_cell_neg_188	as this feature has been around for over a decade from Palm
1_cell_neg_189	and perfected by Blackberry . . .
1_cell_neg_190	how hard can it be ?
1_cell_neg_191	There are probably annoying nits that I have with the software ,
1_cell_neg_192	but those are the major ones .
1_cell_neg_193	And they are major .
1_cell_neg_194	Considering this is Windows Mobile 5.0 what on earth were they
1_cell_neg_195	doing for 1.0 , 2.0 ,
1_cell_neg_196	etc . ?
1_cell_neg_197	Service Provider Pro
1_cell_neg_198	- T-Mobile is useful to me for traveling in Europe .
1_cell_neg_199	They have much better coverage over there than in the US
1_cell_neg_200	-LRB-
1_cell_neg_201	where I 'm actually paying -RRB- .
1_cell_neg_202	- Their package is competitive .
1_cell_neg_203	Service Provider Con :
1_cell_neg_204	- Coverage is not good enough .
1_cell_neg_205	I 'm in San Francisco
1_cell_neg_206	and I have dead spots in my house .
1_cell_neg_207	- Their back-end connectivity with your email providers is terribly buggy .
1_cell_neg_208	At random times
1_cell_neg_209	you will get cryptic messages
1_cell_neg_210	saying
1_cell_neg_211	that you must have something wrong with your connection
1_cell_neg_212	and emails ca n't be accessed .
1_cell_neg_213	But you know
1_cell_neg_214	there 's nothing
1_cell_neg_215	wrong with your connection
1_cell_neg_216	because you ` ve been on the browser .
1_cell_neg_217	Also ,
1_cell_neg_218	there was a whole day
1_cell_neg_219	that emails were not accessible .
1_cell_neg_220	Because of the many issues
1_cell_neg_221	that I 'd
1_cell_neg_222	had with email
1_cell_neg_223	set up
1_cell_neg_224	and maintaining a connection
1_cell_neg_225	I went through various debug routines
1_cell_neg_226	wondering what had failed .
1_cell_neg_227	When I finally called technical support
1_cell_neg_228	they told me
1_cell_neg_229	that their service was down - no apology , no notification , no nothing .
1_cell_neg_230	Certainly no minutes to make up for the inconvenience .
1_cell_neg_231	-LRB- So ,
1_cell_neg_232	why did n't I call technical support earlier ?
1_cell_neg_233	read below . . . -RRB-
1_cell_neg_234	- Their technical support structure is terrible .
1_cell_neg_235	"I have collectively wasted over 12 hours of my life on their "" help "" line ."
1_cell_neg_236	I 'm not going to go into details as it would just take too long .
1_cell_neg_237	Bottom line ,
1_cell_neg_238	if you have a problem with your phone say
1_cell_neg_239	"Dash "" at the prompt"
1_cell_neg_240	and
1_cell_neg_241	then ask for Tier Three Data support .
1_cell_neg_242	Everything you get
1_cell_neg_243	before that is a waste of your time as the technicians
1_cell_neg_244	you ` ll encounter have inadequate training .
1_cell_neg_245	If you are then put on hold and are given another number
1_cell_neg_246	to dial - DO NOT DO IT -
1_cell_neg_247	This cycles
1_cell_neg_248	you back around to Tier Two Data Support
1_cell_neg_249	and you have to go back to the back of the line for someone
1_cell_neg_250	that understands the device .
1_cell_neg_251	So , should you buy
1_cell_neg_252	it ?
1_cell_neg_253	Wait until Windows Mobile 6.0 comes out at least .
1_cell_neg_254	Maybe another provider will pick up the device by that time .
1_cell_neg_255	Then see what else is available
