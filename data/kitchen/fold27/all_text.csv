7_kitchen_neg_1	When I ordered this product ,
7_kitchen_neg_2	it had a 4 star average rating -
7_kitchen_neg_3	how that happened is beyond me .
7_kitchen_neg_4	Were a zero star rating available , this product would n't even deserve the string of uncolored stars !
7_kitchen_neg_5	I purchased
7_kitchen_neg_6	it ,
7_kitchen_neg_7	thinking
7_kitchen_neg_8	"it would certainly do better than the plastic "" freebie "" grinder"
7_kitchen_neg_9	that came with some peppercorns about a year ago .
7_kitchen_neg_10	After many refills ,
7_kitchen_neg_11	that all-plastic grinder has finially started to wear out
7_kitchen_neg_12	and peppercorns get
7_kitchen_neg_13	"stuck in the "" gears "" , the grinder has started to squeak and spits out chunks of pepper ."
7_kitchen_neg_14	So I order this one -- it 's attractive , low\/mid priced
7_kitchen_neg_15	and offers a warranty against wearing out --
7_kitchen_neg_16	and guess what ?
7_kitchen_neg_17	I 'm still using the plastic worn-out grinder !
7_kitchen_neg_18	This MIU grinder was a total waste of money and I just ca n't bear to listen to it squeal
7_kitchen_neg_19	when I attempt
7_kitchen_neg_20	to use it .
7_kitchen_neg_21	Its adjustement is loose enough ,
7_kitchen_neg_22	that 's not the problem .
7_kitchen_neg_23	What good 's a lifetime warranty against wearing out if I 'm not going to use the grinder at all ?
7_kitchen_neg_24	Now I 'm stuck with it ,
7_kitchen_neg_25	unless I want to pay to ship it back
7_kitchen_neg_26	and lose free shipping discount on the original order , so basically , I may could get a few bucks back .
7_kitchen_neg_27	Which is probably what I ` ll do
7_kitchen_neg_28	because this grinder is n't worth 2 cents !
7_kitchen_neg_29	I would n't even give the thing away .
7_kitchen_neg_30	Maybe pepper grinders are one of those things you just need to feel and buy in person .
7_kitchen_neg_31	I ` ll certainly not purchase another one online .
7_kitchen_neg_32	If you like the sound of fingernails
7_kitchen_neg_33	scratching a chalkboard , buy this grinder .
7_kitchen_neg_34	Buy a second one for your salt
7_kitchen_neg_35	while you ` re at it .
7_kitchen_neg_36	You ` ll love 'em !
7_kitchen_neg_37	-LRB- Update 1 month later - I tried
7_kitchen_neg_38	to give this thing a chance
7_kitchen_neg_39	and the god-awful squealing is becoming less consistent .
7_kitchen_neg_40	Which might be even worse ,
7_kitchen_neg_41	as it now takes me by surprise as it lets out a high-pitched jag every so often .
7_kitchen_neg_42	It 's gotten quite worse , however ,
7_kitchen_neg_43	with spitting out various sized chunks of peppercorn . . .
7_kitchen_neg_44	from fine
7_kitchen_neg_45	grind to quarter-corn sized pieces
7_kitchen_neg_46	in a few turns .
7_kitchen_neg_47	Not recommended at all .
7_kitchen_neg_48	I might try switching it over to salt , maybe it can handle that better .
