5_cell_neg_1	I have owned Palm organizers since the days of the original Palm Pilot
5_cell_neg_2	and have loved them
5_cell_neg_3	-LRB-
5_cell_neg_4	I think
5_cell_neg_5	I had three different models over the years -RRB- .
5_cell_neg_6	I wanted a smart phone
5_cell_neg_7	so I could check my email
5_cell_neg_8	so I gravitated to the Treo 680 so I could stay with a Palm product and so I could stay with my current mobile provider , Cingular .
5_cell_neg_9	Now I am
5_cell_neg_10	counting the days
5_cell_neg_11	until my 2 year commitment ends
5_cell_neg_12	so I can punt this awful , awful product .
5_cell_neg_13	I may even bite the bullet
5_cell_neg_14	and pay off my commitment early
5_cell_neg_15	just so I can get rid of it .
5_cell_neg_16	The battery problem is huge .
5_cell_neg_17	You must remember to stick this in a charger
5_cell_neg_18	whenever you can .
5_cell_neg_19	If you forget and leave it in your pocket overnight then it will be dead the next day .
5_cell_neg_20	I have turned off every thing
5_cell_neg_21	I can find that sucks power
5_cell_neg_22	and it still drains amazingly fast .
5_cell_neg_23	It wo n't even last a day if you make very many calls .
5_cell_neg_24	The reception is terrible .
5_cell_neg_25	I ` ve had a Cingular phone for a long time and was able to get good reception over most of So .
5_cell_neg_26	California
5_cell_neg_27	-LRB- except for my house of course -RRB- .
5_cell_neg_28	With this phone
5_cell_neg_29	I think
5_cell_neg_30	you have to be right underneath an antenna
5_cell_neg_31	to get a signal .
5_cell_neg_32	I was on a conference
5_cell_neg_33	call yesterday
5_cell_neg_34	and got dropped twice .
5_cell_neg_35	I am envious everytime
5_cell_neg_36	I get in an elevator with someone
5_cell_neg_37	who can talk on their cell phone
5_cell_neg_38	because mine will freeze up any time
5_cell_neg_39	I try that .
5_cell_neg_40	Yes ,
5_cell_neg_41	it freezes up often .
5_cell_neg_42	The only way I have found to unfreeze it is to take out the battery
5_cell_neg_43	and let it do a hard reboot .
5_cell_neg_44	The versa mail program that it came with from Cingular is hard to work with .
5_cell_neg_45	You must leave your work computer on to check the corporate mail .
5_cell_neg_46	That means if I am traveling with my computer ,
5_cell_neg_47	the phone 's corporate mail program will not work .
5_cell_neg_48	It often will not sync anyway .
5_cell_neg_49	I do n't think the browser
5_cell_neg_50	that comes with the phone will work with Java , so I can not check my Yahoo mail either .
5_cell_neg_51	I tried
5_cell_neg_52	going back and forth to the pre-Java version of Yahoo
5_cell_neg_53	and that is too much of a pain .
5_cell_neg_54	I get all kinds of weird messages with the phone .
5_cell_neg_55	I have n't ever been able to sync up the Palm features because of some legacy files from my previus palm software , something
5_cell_neg_56	that never happened
5_cell_neg_57	when I upgraded before .
5_cell_neg_58	Yes ,
5_cell_neg_59	there is a manual
5_cell_neg_60	that is huge .
5_cell_neg_61	It is hard to use on line so I guess
5_cell_neg_62	I need
5_cell_neg_63	to bite the bullet
5_cell_neg_64	and print out the whole thing
5_cell_neg_65	and then take a week of vacation
5_cell_neg_66	to read it
5_cell_neg_67	and see if I can make any
5_cell_neg_68	of these neat functions that I read about work .
5_cell_neg_69	Hardly a week goes by that I do n't actively think
5_cell_neg_70	how much I hate this phone .
5_cell_neg_71	I actually signed on to Amazon today
5_cell_neg_72	just to write this
5_cell_neg_73	because the phone was n't working properly today .
5_cell_neg_74	What a piece
5_cell_neg_75	of junk !
