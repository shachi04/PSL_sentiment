9_cellphone_pos_1	Note :
9_cellphone_pos_2	I am transitioning from using the Sony Ericsson P910i smartphone
9_cellphone_pos_3	so my review is based on how well the w710i 's features work in comparison .
9_cellphone_pos_4	I purchased this
9_cellphone_pos_5	because I go to remote areas
9_cellphone_pos_6	and the P910i needs heavy bandwidth in order for the phone to function .
9_cellphone_pos_7	My son 's Z500 would work in areas
9_cellphone_pos_8	my p910i would not .
9_cellphone_pos_9	Review is based on 1 week of usage .
9_cellphone_pos_10	I ` ve also purchased the z710i for my son
9_cellphone_pos_11	and will review that one later .
9_cellphone_pos_12	Strengths :
9_cellphone_pos_13	\* Improved picture quality of 2.0 megapixels vs. 1.3
9_cellphone_pos_14	\* Excellent voice quality with headsets
9_cellphone_pos_15	-LRB- wired or bluetooth -RRB-

9_cellphone_pos_24	\* Ability to buy an international SIM card
9_cellphone_pos_25	to avoid extra fees
9_cellphone_pos_26	\* Sync cord charges the battery
9_cellphone_pos_27	\* Can double as a modem via bluetooth or usb cable
9_cellphone_pos_28	-LRB- if you do n't have unlimited internet package be very careful
9_cellphone_pos_29	as they charge big $ $ $ -RRB-
9_cellphone_pos_30	\* FM radio - reception is so-so in the downtown area
9_cellphone_pos_31	\* standard or flight mode option
9_cellphone_pos_32	to use while on airplane
9_cellphone_pos_33	\* Edge technology - my p10i did not have this .
9_cellphone_pos_34	I can download email extremely quickly now ! ! !
9_cellphone_pos_35	\* step counter & calories expended
9_cellphone_pos_36	Neutral :
9_cellphone_pos_37	\* The international charger with an adapter for US outlets .
9_cellphone_pos_38	It is very wobbly in the outlet .
9_cellphone_pos_39	I ` ll invest in a US version .
9_cellphone_pos_40	\* Inability to sync with any computer
9_cellphone_pos_41	using Windows Vista
9_cellphone_pos_42	-LRB- I 'm sure a workaround is coming -RRB-
9_cellphone_pos_43	\* I have n't used the armband yet
9_cellphone_pos_44	but it may improve the stepcounter 's accuracy .
9_cellphone_pos_45	\* Others have warned about holdling the phone
9_cellphone_pos_46	and interferring with the antenna ,
9_cellphone_pos_47	I have n't had a problem with this .
9_cellphone_pos_48	\* Over-the-ear earbuds do n't fall out !
9_cellphone_pos_49	Weaknesses :
9_cellphone_pos_50	\* Since I have other Sony phones ,
9_cellphone_pos_51	I am
9_cellphone_pos_52	disappointed
9_cellphone_pos_53	that they have changed the shape of the connection for the sync and charger .
9_cellphone_pos_54	Translation ,
9_cellphone_pos_55	you can no longer use the current chargers of the previous generation phones .
9_cellphone_pos_56	\* There is no way to charge the phone
9_cellphone_pos_57	and use the wired headset .
9_cellphone_pos_58	You either listen to the radio or charge the phone .
9_cellphone_pos_59	\* You can not use the standard over-the-counter headsets
9_cellphone_pos_60	because there is no outlet for it .
9_cellphone_pos_61	\* Need to switch settings
9_cellphone_pos_62	to view more than one email account
9_cellphone_pos_63	\* Yet another memory card format -LRB- micro -RRB- another adapter
9_cellphone_pos_64	needed
9_cellphone_pos_65	\* Memory card only 512mb
9_cellphone_pos_66	-LRB- can purchase 1 or 2gb -RRB-
9_cellphone_pos_67	\* picture caller id only works

9_cellphone_pos_69	-LRB- edit March 21,2007 -
9_cellphone_pos_70	if you have answer on open set -RRB-
9_cellphone_pos_71	I purchased my W710i from an internet company for $ 254.00
9_cellphone_pos_72	and it was shipped directly from Hong Kong in 2 business days .
9_cellphone_pos_73	I 'm unsure if I can provide their name here .
9_cellphone_pos_74	Overall :
9_cellphone_pos_75	Sony has always produced quality products .
9_cellphone_pos_76	I love this phone
9_cellphone_pos_77	and it is a very good comparison to a SmartPhone .
9_cellphone_pos_78	I do miss using my styllus .
9_cellphone_pos_79	If you do n't need the bells and whistles of a smartphone , go for the Z710i as it is a bit cheaper but a great contender .
9_cellphone_pos_80	If I could rate it more than 5 stars ,
9_cellphone_pos_81	I would even though I have n't tried all of the features of this phone .
9_cellphone_pos_82	Buy it without hesitation !
9_cellphone_pos_83	ADDENDUM March 5 , 2007
9_cellphone_pos_84	I dropped the phone on a tiled bathroom floor .
9_cellphone_pos_85	When it hit , the clip , battery cover and battery
9_cellphone_pos_86	scattered in different directions on the floor .
9_cellphone_pos_87	Amazingly , the phone still operates .
9_cellphone_pos_88	The damage is a barely noticeable mark on the upper left of the phone .
9_cellphone_pos_89	A mark like that
9_cellphone_pos_90	could happen in my purse !
9_cellphone_pos_91	I am really impressed now
9_cellphone_pos_92	but hope I never do that again !
