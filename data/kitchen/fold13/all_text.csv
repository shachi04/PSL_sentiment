13_kitchen_pos_1	I have been using a Chemex 10-cup coffee maker for several weeks and have never had such good coffee before in my life .
13_kitchen_pos_2	I am constantly looking forward to my next pot of coffee !
13_kitchen_pos_3	There is a downside to this coffee maker :
13_kitchen_pos_4	it is a more manual procedure than what you are used to ,
13_kitchen_pos_5	and it also takes a couple of pots
13_kitchen_pos_6	to learn
13_kitchen_pos_7	how to use this most efficiently .
13_kitchen_pos_8	The first time I tried to use mine ,
13_kitchen_pos_9	I had ground my coffee way too finely and it just took forever !
13_kitchen_pos_10	The big time consumers :
13_kitchen_pos_11	you have to boil your water separately
13_kitchen_pos_12	-LRB- you do have a water kettle right ? -RRB-
13_kitchen_pos_13	and then you have to gradually pour the boiled water through the Chemex .
13_kitchen_pos_14	This means that while the coffee is brewing ,
13_kitchen_pos_15	you are pouring , or watching , or giving the filter area a bit of a stir .
13_kitchen_pos_16	Now the up side :
13_kitchen_pos_17	you will never ever ever drink a better cup of coffee .
13_kitchen_pos_18	I use filtered water , freshly ground home roasted beans , and this Chemex to produce the finest coffee
13_kitchen_pos_19	I have ever had the pleasure of drinking .
13_kitchen_pos_20	And this coffee is a pleasure !
13_kitchen_pos_21	In fact ,
13_kitchen_pos_22	I ` ve totally given up using cream and sugar
13_kitchen_pos_23	because my coffee no longer has anything to hide .
13_kitchen_pos_24	Another up side :
13_kitchen_pos_25	clean up means
13_kitchen_pos_26	swishing the Chemex with warm water
13_kitchen_pos_27	and tossing the water down the drain .
13_kitchen_pos_28	You can also wash with a bottle brush
13_kitchen_pos_29	but this is rarely necessary .
13_kitchen_pos_30	A brief swish is really all
13_kitchen_pos_31	it takes to get your Chemex
13_kitchen_pos_32	looking factory new .
13_kitchen_pos_33	Try that with your electric drip machine !
13_kitchen_pos_34	Ha ! That thing will NEVER look brand new !
13_kitchen_pos_35	Oh , here 's a final upside :
13_kitchen_pos_36	this Chemex brews the best coffee
13_kitchen_pos_37	you ` ll ever drink ,
13_kitchen_pos_38	and it costs less than just about anything .
13_kitchen_pos_39	You are probably already spending more money than this every month at Starbucks !
13_kitchen_pos_40	Go ahead
13_kitchen_pos_41	and buy yourself one of these .
13_kitchen_pos_42	If necessary , wake up 10 minutes earlier to make your coffee .
13_kitchen_pos_43	Better yet , wake up 20 minutes earlier .
13_kitchen_pos_44	And
13_kitchen_pos_45	when your coffee is ready , instead of dumping it into a travel cup
13_kitchen_pos_46	and bolting out the door , sit down
13_kitchen_pos_47	and enjoy your first cup for the next 10 minutes .
13_kitchen_pos_48	You deserve it !
13_kitchen_pos_49	UPDATE :
13_kitchen_pos_50	It 's been a year now
13_kitchen_pos_51	and I still love this Chemex .
13_kitchen_pos_52	However , over time the glass acquired a coffee color tinge
13_kitchen_pos_53	that gradually became darker with each use .
13_kitchen_pos_54	Nothing I tried got it clean ,
13_kitchen_pos_55	but something my wife tried did :
13_kitchen_pos_56	a splash of bleach in otherwise clean water
13_kitchen_pos_57	followed by a thorough swishing .
13_kitchen_pos_58	Now my Chemex
13_kitchen_pos_59	looks brand new
