17_gourmet_pos_2	Tazo 's Lotus Decaffeinated Green Tea is one of my favorite Tazo teas .
17_gourmet_pos_3	The lotus flower flavor is pleasant and delightful .
17_gourmet_pos_4	This tea is not bitter or harsh in any way .
17_gourmet_pos_5	It is one of the most natural-tasting of the Tazo 's I ` ve tasted , very subtle ,
17_gourmet_pos_6	and much less artificial-tasting .
17_gourmet_pos_7	The ingredients in Lotus are :
17_gourmet_pos_8	naturally decaffeinated green tea , natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors .
17_gourmet_pos_9	Of course , this tea is caffeine-free .
17_gourmet_pos_10	Tazo is an interesting company
17_gourmet_pos_11	that makes only super premium teas .
17_gourmet_pos_12	They are socially responsible ,
17_gourmet_pos_13	"based in Portland , and have the motto , "" The Reincarnation of Tea "" ."
17_gourmet_pos_14	Tazo is owned by Starbucks .
17_gourmet_pos_15	Their web site is fun and quirky , with a Zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out .
17_gourmet_pos_16	It is unclear ,
17_gourmet_pos_17	though , from their web site ,
17_gourmet_pos_18	how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher ,
17_gourmet_pos_19	"and they do use some "" natural flavors """
17_gourmet_pos_20	in their teas
17_gourmet_pos_21	--
17_gourmet_pos_22	this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea .
17_gourmet_pos_23	On the paper tea packet ,
17_gourmet_pos_24	Tazo writes ,
17_gourmet_pos_25	"delightfully subtle green tea with the inner radiance and essence of lotus flower . """
17_gourmet_pos_26	"On their web site , Tazo describes the flavor profile of Lotus as "" peach , nutty , flowery , overripe melon ."
17_gourmet_pos_27	"This surprisingly full-flavored yet delicately floral blend is clean and light-bodied , with an aroma reminiscent of freesia . """
17_gourmet_pos_28	"Tazo also describes the aroma as "" tropical fruit , green tea "" ."
17_gourmet_pos_29	Hmmm . . .
17_gourmet_pos_30	I do n't taste all of these various flavors ,
17_gourmet_pos_31	and
17_gourmet_pos_32	I suspect
17_gourmet_pos_33	that Tazo really pushes the creative writing limit .
17_gourmet_pos_34	I taste green tea ,
17_gourmet_pos_35	and a nice flowery flavor ,
17_gourmet_pos_36	which I 'm assuming is the lotus ,
17_gourmet_pos_37	but not the rest -- the peach , nuts , melon , freesia , tropical fruit --
17_gourmet_pos_38	they ` re missing from what I can discern here .
17_gourmet_pos_39	I would rate this tea , and Tazo in general , as good -- better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings --
17_gourmet_pos_40	but not as good as Numi .
17_gourmet_pos_41	I 'm soooooo
17_gourmet_pos_42	spoiled by Numi teas ,
17_gourmet_pos_43	which is why Tazo Lotus gets only four stars .
