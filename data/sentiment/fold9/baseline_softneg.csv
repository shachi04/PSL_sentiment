a  concern 	0.0001
that  has  proved  well  founded  . 	0.0001
I  was  originally  concerned 	0.125

-LRB-  SIM  was  not  activated  \/  in  the  system  -RRB- 	0.375
I  bought  this  phone  as  part  of  the  Sprint\/Nextel  SERO  plan  . 	0.0001
I  used  it  for  about  14  days  before  deciding 	0.0001
that  it  did  n't  fit  my  needs  for  several  reasons 	0.125
outlined  below  : 	0.0001
-  Battery  life  was  sporadic  -- 	0.375
I  got  maybe  a  day  worth  of  power  from  it  . 	0.0001
One  time  it  completely 	0.0001
discharged  overnight  . 	0.0001
For  the  price  of  the  phone 	0.0001
-LRB-  and  the  two  year  contract  it  carries  -RRB- 	0.0001
this  is  a  dealbreaker  . 	0.125
-  The  Nextel  network  coverage  has  gone  downhill  in  my  area 	0.0001
-LRB-  I  was  a  former  Nextel  subscriber  for  3  years 	0.125
- 	0.0001
so  I  have  some  experience  with  coverage  around  town  -RRB-  . 	0.0001
I  was  getting  disconnects 	0.1875
and  sporadic  no  signals  . 	0.625
-  The  phone  would  sporadically  mute  the  ringer  . 	0.0001
An  incoming  call  would  light  up  the  display 	0.0001
but  there  would  be  no  ringing  . 	0.1875
This  seems 	0.0001
to  happen 	0.0001
after  I  had  put  the  phone  on  vibrate 	0.0001
and  then  turned  it  back 	0.0001
to  ring  . 	0.0001
-  For  the  same  monthly  service  fee  , 	0.0001
I  was  getting  less  access  to  web  services  and  no  high  speed  Internet  ability  . 	0.2916666666666667
Admittedly  the  high  speed  access  is  not  as  useful  on  a  tiny  screen  -- 	0.3333333333333333
but  if  I  'm  going  to  be  locked  into  a  2  year  contract 	0.125
I  would  like  to  have  some  fast  internet  access  on  the  phone  . 	0.0001
The  i880  still  uses  the  slow  Nextel  data  network  . 	0.125
I  was  not  a  Direct  Connect\/Walkie  Talkie  user  . 	0.3333333333333333
If  I  were  , 	0.125
then  my  opinion  of  this  phone  might  be  a  little  higher 	0.34375
-LRB-  since  Nextel  presently  has  arguably  the  best  fully  functioning  walkie  talkie  network  -RRB-  . 	0.125
I  could  not  justify  being  locked  into  a  2  year  contract  with  equipment 	0.375
that  seemed  sub-par  on  a  network 	0.0001
that  did  not 	0.625
-LRB-  and  likely  never  will  -RRB-  support  the  latest  high  speed  technologies  . 	0.3333333333333333
Below  were  my  initial  impressions  during  the  time  I  used  the  phone  : 	0.125
Thankfully  Motorola  designed  the  phone 	0.0001
so  the  micro-SD  card  is  accessible  from  the  outside  -- 	0.125
no  need  to  pull  the  battery 	0.125
to  update  the  card  . 	0.0001
Here  's  the  big  things 	0.125
I  do  n't  like  . 	0.0001
1  . 	0.0001
You  CAN  NOT  use  any  mp3  songs 	0.625
that  you  transfer  to  the  micro-sd  card  as  ringtones  . 	0.0001
2  .  You  also  can  not  readily  load  additional  wallpapers 	0.625
unless  it  is  a  picture 	0.125
you  took  with  the  phone  or  a  paid  download  . 	0.0001
Any  message 	0.0001
-LRB-  mms  -RRB- 	0.0001
that  you  send  to  yourself  can  only  be  set  as  a  caller  id  image  and  not  wallpaper  . 	0.375
3  .  Battery  life  on  my  phone  is  flaky  - 	0.125
I  'm  getting  maybe  a  day  and  one-half  with  usage 	0.0001
that  approximates  60  minutes  talk  time  and  perhaps  6  to  10  picture  messages  . 	0.0001
You  must  pay  Nextel  to  download  ringtones  . 	0.0001
There  are  some  users 	0.125
who  have  modified  the  phone 	0.375
and  reportedly  are  able  to  use  ringtones  off  their  micro-SD  memory  card  -  however  the  process  is  more  technical  than  what  your  average  user  might  want  to  tangle  with  . 	0.25
Note  : 	0.0001
Sprint  and  Nextel  are  both  owned  by  the  same  company  . 	0.125
If  you  `  re  making  a  decision  on  Sprint  vs  . 	0.0001
Nextel  , 	0.0001
there  are  only  a  couple  reasons 	0.125
that  I  can  think  of 	0.0001
to  recommend  Nextel  over  Sprint  . 	0.125
First  , 	0.0001
if  the  Nextel  coverage  is  better  . 	0.125
Second  , 	0.0001
if  you  have  a  need 	0.125
to  use  the  Nextel  Walkie  Talkie  feature  . 	0.0001
The  Sprint  side  of  the  company  features  phones  with  significantly  enhanced  web  browsing  and  higher  speed  data  communications  . 	0.25
The  Nextel  side  clings  to  the  larger  phones 	0.125
and  aims  their  services  at  the  industrial\/construction  market  . 	0.0001
For  almost  every  consumer  ,  the  Sprint  side  is  a  better  deal  . 	0.125
Sprint  in  my  experience  has  better  customer  service 	0.0001
whereas  Nextel  tends  to  transfer  you  endlessly  among  a  variety  of  customer  service  representatives  . 	0.0001
Here  's  my  summary  of  this  phone 	0.0001
after  using  it  about  two  weeks  : 	0.0001
The  Good  : 	0.0001
-  beautiful  speaker  phone 	0.0001
-  compact  design  \/  solid  feel 	0.0001
-2  megapixel  camera  ,  ability  to  capture  movies 	0.125
-  flip  swings  open 	0.375
when  you  push  a  button 	0.0001
-  Nextel  sms\/mms  messages  can  now  be  auto-downloaded  - 	0.125
I  believe 	0.0001
this  is  the  first  Nextel  phone  to  sport  this  feature 	0.1875
-  nice  loud  audio 	0.0001
-  both  Nextel  walkie  talkie  and  DirecTalk  support 	0.0001
The  Bad  : 	0.875
-  ca  n't  play  ringtones  off  Micro  SD  or  via  any  other  non-Nextel  transfer 	0.625
-LRB-  Note  : 	0.0001
Technically  some  people  have  been  using 	0.125
a  Motorola  product  called  webjal  to  make  transfers  with  a  cable  - 	0.0001
but  this  may  be  more  technical 	0.125
than  the  average  user  would  like  to  tackle  -RRB- 	0.0001
-  Nextel  is  in  my  opinion  on  their  way  out  as  a  carrier  ,  soon  to  be  completely  assimilated  into  the  Sprint  side  of  things  . 	0.225
While  not  entirely  unexpected  , 	0.625
it  means  that  Nextel  plans  and  features  are  not  as  attractive  to  non-construction  users 	0.375
-LRB-  Nextel  's  core  group  -RRB-  . 	0.0001
If  you  want  Mobile  to  Mobile  unlimited  minutes 	0.0001
you  pay  more  versus  most  Sprint  plans 	0.0001
which  include  them  . 	0.0001
Nextel  does  n't  have  the  super  fast  data  speeds  or  network  web  browsing  of  competing  carriers  . 	0.0001
Most  web  browsing  on  Nextel  is  limited  to  character 	0.125
based  wap  sites 	0.0001
that  both  crawl  along  speedwise  and  present  unexciting  character 	0.0001
based  screens  . 	0.0001
-  the  phone  is  a  little  bigger 	0.20833333333333331
that  what  some  have  grown  accustomed  to  . 	0.0001
- 	0.0001
while  not  phone  related  ,  some  users  in  larger  cities  have  reported 	0.375
the  iDen  system  is  nearing  capactity  with  a  lot  of  busy  signals  . 	0.125
-  I  am  only  getting  about  a  day  of  battery  life  - 	0.125
which  is  extremely  low  . 	0.1875
I  `  ve  lusted  after  a  Super  Auto  for  years  . 	0.0001
When  I  finally  decided  to  get  one  , 	0.0001
I  did  a  fare  amount  of  investigating  . 	0.0001
The  Gaggia  Titanium  had  the  best  spec  's  for  the  price  and  good  reviews  . 	0.0001
I  decided  to  spend  the  extra  money  for  the  Stainless  unit  . 	0.0001
I  have  n't  seen  the  painted  plastic  model 	0.0001
so  I  ca  n't  comment  on  the  appearance  . 	0.0001
I  do  think 	0.0001
the  Stainless  looks  great  ! 	0.0001
You  can  find  reviews  of  the  non-stainless  here  on  Amazon  and  other  than  the  outside  appearance  ,  the  device  is  the  same  . 	0.375
I  `  ve  only  had  the  unit  for  a  few  days 	0.0001
but  so  far  , 	0.0001
I  'm  very  happy  . 	0.25
To  the  negatives  first  . 	0.25
The  manual  is  awful  ! 	0.5
It  's  not  just  the  Italian  to  English  translation  ! 	0.625
The  text  is  skimpy  and  the  illustrations  not  so  great  . 	0.375
I  spent 	0.0001
a  fair  amount  of  time  making  sure 	0.0001
I  understood 	0.0001
how  to  setup  and  use  the  unit  . 	0.0001
I  'm  pretty  technically  savvy  and  in  the  end  , 	0.25
I  figured  it  all  out  . 	0.0001
But  do  n't  rush  into  using  this  product 	0.0001
until  you  `  ve  figured  out 	0.0001
how  to  set  it  up  ,  clean  it 	0.375
and  adjust  all  the  settings 	0.0001
-LRB-  there  are  many  -RRB-  . 	0.125
The  only  issue  I  `  ve  had  is  whereby  the  auto  bean  grinder  thinks 	0.125
it  's  empty 	0.0001
when  it  's  not  . 	0.625
Open  the  lid 	0.0001
-LRB- 	0.0001
which  could  be  a  bit  better  designed  -RRB- 	0.125
and  stir  and 	0.0001
it  works  . 	0.0001
Could  be  the  beans 	0.125
I  'm  using  not  sure  . 	0.5625
It  's  an  intermittent  issue  . 	0.0001
The  good  stuff  : 	0.0001
once  you  figure  out  the  coffee  strength  and  grind  ,  the  Gaggia  makes  a  delicious  cup  . 	0.5
I  wish 	0.375
the  brew  were  a  tad  hotter 	0.125
-LRB-  I  have  it  set  to  max  -RRB- 	0.0001
but  using  the  cup  warmer  helps  . 	0.0001
No  issues  making  froth  with  the  wand  ; 	0.0001
much  better  than  the  older  manual  machine 	0.0001
I  had  . 	0.0001
You  ca  n't  put  a  huge  mug  under  the  unit 	0.25
-LRB-  the  max  size  is  4.5  inches  -RRB- 	0.25
but  its  so  easy  to  make  a  cup  you  just  make  fresh 	0.4375
when  needed  . 	0.25
You  can  set  the  unit  for  the  amount  of  brew  . 	0.0001
However  , 	0.5
"I  found  that  clicking  the  ""  large  coffee  ""  button  twice  ,  the  unit  thinks "	0.125
it  's  making  2  cups 	0.0001
and  that  just  about  fills  a  decent  size  mug  . 	0.3333333333333333
It  's  much  stronger  too  since  the  unit  grinds  two  doses  of  coffee  instead  of  just  adding  more  hot  water 	0.375
using  the  programmable  size  . 	0.375
You  get  a  nice  foam  on  top 	0.0001
and  as  I  said  , 	0.0001
the  coffee  is  outstanding  . 	0.125
I  love  the  clean  up 	0.375
-LRB-  or  lack  of  -RRB- 	0.125
compared  to  the  drip  maker  I  had  -LRB-  a  Bodum  Vacuum  unit  -RRB-  . 	0.25
I  still  have  that  unit 	0.125
should  I  need  to  make  a  lot  of  coffee  for  company  . 	0.25
But  for  the  two  mugs 	0.25
I  drink  in  the  morning  , 	0.0001
the  Gaggia  easily  replaces  this  unit  . 	0.5
And  there  's  far  less  cleanup  . 	0.5
The  grinds  sit  in  a  canister 	0.5
and  after  a  few  days  , 	0.0001
you  just  tap  it  out  into  the  trash 	0.125
and  maybe  rinse  . 	0.0001
So  , 	0.0001
you  can  use  this  Gaggia  to  replace  a  conventional  coffee  machine  as  long  as  you  `  re  making  a  cup  or  two  . 	0.4375
What  I  love  is  just  pressing  a  button  twice 	0.125
-LRB-  for  two  large  coffees  -RRB- 	0.125
and  walking  away  from  the  unit  . 	0.0001
A  minute  later  ,  a  great  cup  of  Joe  . 	0.0001
It  truly  is  super  automatic  . 	0.125
I  have  the  unit 	0.0001
set  for  Energy  savor 	0.125
whereby  it  's  in  a  kind  of  sleep  mode  a  few  hours  after  I  use  it  . 	0.0001
I  only  drink  in  the  morning  . 	0.0001
However  , 	0.5
"if  you  decide  to  ""  wake  it  up  ""  , "	0.0001
it  heats  up  in  about  2  minutes  . 	0.0001
It  also  does  a  rinse  cycle 	0.0001
so  I  keep  a  small  glass  under  the  unit  so  it  can  clean  itself 	0.25
and  rinse  out  about  3oz  of  water  . 	0.0001
There  is  a  little  pan 	0.25
under  which  would  catch  the  water 	0.0001
but  then  you  have  to  toss  it  out  ever  few  days  . 	0.0001
"There  's  also  a  ""  full  Rinse  ""  cycle "	0.0001
that  thoroughly  cleans  out  the  unit 	0.125
and  uses  about  half  the  water  in  the  reservoir  . 	0.0001
It  's  a  menu  item 	0.0001
so  do  n't  select  it 	0.0001
unless  you  really  want  to  do  this 	0.0001
-LRB-  takes  about  5  minutes  and  a  lot  of  water  goes  into  the  catch  pan  or  several  cups  if  you  so  desire  -RRB-  . 	0.375
Yes  it  cost  big  bucks 	0.3125
but  as  long  as  it  works  well  for  years 	0.0001
and  keeps  its  great  looks  , 	0.0001
I  'm  very  happy  . 	0.25
UPDATE  . 	0.0001
The  issue  with  the  grinder  was  the  beans 	0.125
-LRB-  too  oily  -RRB-  . 	0.25
I  called  the  NY  office 	0.0001
"and  got  someone  in  ""  tech  support  "" "	0.0001
in  minutes  . 	0.0001
She  knew 	0.0001
her  product  . 	0.0001
Sure  enough  ,  the  inside  of  the  grinder  area  was  super  oily 	0.125
making  it  hard  for  the  beans 	0.125
to  fall  into  the  grinder  area  . 	0.0001
Within  a  few  weeks  of  purchase 	0.0001
the  teflon  in  the  Zojirushi  pan  started  to  blister  and  flake  off  . 	0.25
This  is  NOT  the  result  of  customer  abuse  but  a  manufacturing  defect  . 	0.4375
This  is  my  third  -LRB-  and  final  -RRB- 	0.125
bread  machine  . 	0.0001
The  first  two  were  Breadman  Ultimates  . 	0.125
I  should  note  that  I  make  bread  in  the  machine  about  6  times  a  week  on  average  ,  pretty  much  every  morning  . 	0.25
The  first  Breadman  worked  for  over  a  year  until  the  teflon  in  the  pan  started  to  fail  . 	0.125
This  was  probably  my  fault  for  allowing  the  pan 	0.375
to  soak  for  extended  periods  of  time 	0.125
-LRB-  water  can  get  behind  the  teflon 	0.0001
and  ruin  the  bond  -RRB-  . 	0.5
I  bought  an  new  Breadman  Ultimate 	0.0001
because  the  entire  machine  was  only  slightly  more  than  the  pan  alone  and  the  old  machine  was  starting  to  have  mechanical  problems  . 	0.2916666666666667
This  time  I  took  extremely  good  care  of  the  pan 	0.0001
-LRB-  letting  it  cool  down  ,  no  soaking  -RRB- 	0.375
because  it  's  clearly  the  weak  link  in  the  system  . 	0.375
Within  8  months  the  stirring  shaft  that  drives  the  paddle  in  the  pan  simply  fell  out  . 	0.0001
Whatever  the  detente  mechanism  was  that  holds  the  shaft  to  the  pan  failed  , 	0.125
making  the  machine  useless  . 	0.0001
Currently  it  does  n't  seem  very  easy 	0.25
-LRB-  or  even  possible  -RRB- 	0.0001
to  buy  a  replacement  pan  for  the  Breadman  . 	0.0001
At  this  point  I  was  done  with  the  Breadman  . 	0.125
Much  as  I  did  n't  want  to  spring  for  the  extra  money  for  the  Zojirushi  , 	0.0001
and  realizing 	0.0001
that  my  default  augmented 	0.25
sourdough  recipe  probably  would  n't  work  the  same  in  the  new  machine  , 	0.0001
I  did  n't  see  an  alternative 	0.125
and  got  one  . 	0.0001
Within  3  weeks  the  teflon  in  the  Zoji  pan  formed  two  blisters  . 	0.0001
One  is  bit 	0.125
smaller  than  a  dime  and  all  the  teflon  at  this  spot  has  flaked  off  ; 	0.375
the  other  spot  is  blistering 	0.3333333333333333
but  the  teflon  is  still  intact  . 	0.125
I  have  been  extremely  careful  with  the  pan  : 	0.125
I  wait 	0.0001
for  it  to  cool  and  then  remove  the  baked-on  bread  under  the  paddles  with  warm  water  using  mostly  my  fingers  . 	0.0001
I  do  n't  let  it  soak  at  all  . 	0.0001
This  is  clearly  a  manufacturing  defect  . 	0.1875
I  have  further  complaints  with  respect  to  this  machine  as  compared  to  the  Breadman  Ultimate  : 	0.3125
1  -RRB-  The  top  of  the  bread  rarely  gets  brown  . 	0.125
I  `  ve  added  more  sugar  to  the  recipe 	0.0001
which  helps  slightly 	0.0001
but  not  much  . 	0.625
2  -RRB-  I  do  n't  understand  what  the  crust  control  option  does  . 	0.25
It  does  n't  seem  to  increase  baking  time 	0.0001
which  it  does  on  the  Breadman  so  it  does  n't  make  much  sense  . 	0.0001
3  -RRB-  The  programmability  is  very  weak  . 	0.2916666666666667
On  the  Breadman 	0.0001
you  can  take  any  of  the  existing  standard  options 	0.3125
and  modify  them  as  well  as  make  up  entirely  new  programs  . 	0.0001
4  -RRB-  The  programmability  options  are  very  limited  : 	0.20833333333333331
-  You  ca  n't  control  the  knockdown  time  between  risings  . 	0.0001
-  You  ca  n't  add  risings  to  the  default  three  . 	0.25
They  do  give  you  a  lot  of  time  control  on  the  risings  . 	0.0001
-  You  ca  n't  separate  the  mixing  cycle  from  the  kneading  cycle  : 	0.0001
it  's  all  one  cycle  . 	0.0001
- 	0.0001
When  you  turn  off  the  preheat  cycle  , 	0.0001
this  only  affects  the  built-in  programs  and  not  the  custom  ones  . 	0.375
-  And  worst  of  all  : 	0.75
you 	0.0001
ca  n't  bake  for  more  than  70  minutes  . 	0.0001
This  is  utterly  ridiculous  . 	0.125
"I  'm  sure  this  is  a  ""  safety  feature  "" "	0.3125
but  it  means 	0.0001
you  ca  n't  correct  for  the  pathetic  lack  of  crust  formation  or  have  larger  recipes 	0.125
and  so  forth  . 	0.0001
This  is  almost  a  killer  limitation  in  my  opinion  . 	0.375
For  those  other  reviewers 	0.625
that  are  having  issues  with  rising  , 	0.125
I  `  ve  determined 	0.0001
that  the  machine  is  very  sensitive  to  the  amount  ,  type  ,  and  quality  of  yeast  . 	0.1875
If  you  \*  exactly  \*  follow  the  manufacturers  instuctions  with  respect 	0.0001
to  yeast  and  use  fresh  yeast  , 	0.625
it  should  work  okay  . 	0.125
This  means  you  must  use  rapid  rise  yeast  with  the  Quick  programs 	0.0001
and  active  dry  yeast  with  the  longer  standard  programs  . 	0.4375
Even  using  Fleischmann  's  instead  of  Red  Star  made  a  difference  . 	0.5
The  Breadman  was  pretty  much  indifferent  to  yeast  variations  . 	0.1875
At  this  point  I  'm 	0.0001
done  with  bread  machines  . 	0.0001
They  are  a  failed  technology  . 	0.125
In  fact  ,  teflon  is  a  dangerous  and  substandard  technology  . 	0.4375
All  you  have  to  do  is  search  for  teflon 	0.125
-LRB-  Polytetrafluoroethylene  -RRB- 	0.0001

The  manufacturing  process  results  in  significant  environmental  contamination  . 	0.0001
A  direct  consumer  health  risk  due  to  toxic  outgassing  occurs 	0.25

-LRB-  eg  : 	0.0001
frying  pans  -RRB-  . 	0.625
Perhaps  bread  machines  are  not  that  risky 	0.375
given  the  lower  temps 	0.1875
involved  in  baking  and  the  fact 	0.0001
that  wet  dough  will  keep  the  average  pan  temperature  pretty  low  ,  but  if  you  know  anything  about  toxicity 	0.25
you  will  realize  that  it  is  always  a  sliding  scale  : 	0.1875
there  will  be  some  outgassing  at  lower  temperatures  . 	0.1875
Imagine  low  levels  of  toxic  gas 	0.25
released  into  your  homemade  bread  . 	0.0001
I  `  ve  thought  about  this  , 	0.0001
but  there  's  no  way  to  make  a  bread  machine  without  teflon  -- 	0.0001
going  from  mixing  dough  to  baking  requires  teflon  , 	0.25
there  is  just  no  other  viable  solution  . 	0.375
I  love 	0.0001
making  bread  every  day 	0.0001
and  I  'm  going  to  miss  this  activity 	0.0001
but  at  this  point  the  manufacturing  defects  and  use  of  teflon  mean 	0.0001
I  have  to  give  up  on  this  technology  . 	0.125

I  'm  not  sure 	0.5625
why  that  is  considering  the  deduction  of  units  has  zip  to  do  with  the  model  of  the  phone  . 	0.1875

We  purchased  this  machine  for  our  small  coffee  shop  2  months  ago  as  in  the  discription 	0.375

to  be  for  light  commercial  use  . 	0.1875
We  make 	0.0001
probably  20-30  cups  of  coffee  a  day  . 	0.0001
Our  problems  began  the  first  week  after  receiving  it  . 	0.625
The  machine  makes  great  froth  for  cappuccinoes 	0.0001
but  if  you  want  to  have  steamed  milk  instead  of  frothed  it 	0.0001
either  comes  out  of  luke  warm  temperature  allthough  the  setting  is  on  high  temperature  or  if  you  put  the  dial  almost  on  the  line  between  latte  and  cappuccino  it  gives  you  too  much  foam  , 	0.1875
which  lattes  should  n't  have  . 	0.0001
So  customers  complain  about  their  lattes 	0.75

We  called  the  manufacturer  's  customer  service 	0.0001
and  were  rudely  brushed  off  . 	0.125
For  a  small  business  like  us  it  is  hard  to  close  for  2-3  weeks  to  send  the  machine  for  temperature  adjustment  service  ,  so  we  had  to  deal  with  it  . 	0.20833333333333331
Another  problem  came  up  3-4  weeks  later  , 	0.625
when  the  machine  started  shutting  off  by  itself  in  the  middle  of  steaming\/frothing  cycle  or  frother  cleaning  cycle  . 	0.125
Sometimes  we  had  to  restart  it  up  to  5  times  to  make  1  cup  of  hot  chocolate  ,  just  to  steam  milk  . 	0.0001
At  the  customer  service  we  were  told  to  reset  the  computer  by  unplugging  the  machine  for  a  couple  of  hours  , 	0.125
which  we  did  . 	0.0001
It  did  not  shut  off  for  1  day  ! 	0.625
The  next  day  the  problem  started  again  .  .  . 	0.625
I  perform  every  neccessary  cleaning  or  maintenance  procedure  that  machine  prompts  and  cappuccino  cleaning  daily  ,  so  you  can  not  say 	0.5
that  the  machine  is  being  neglected  . 	0.125
We  are  very  disappointed  with  this  machine  . 	0.20833333333333331
