16_cell_pos_1	I bought my V360 on eBay
16_cell_pos_2	and it was sold unlocked\/unbranded
16_cell_pos_3	and it was of the quad-band variety .
16_cell_pos_4	Here 's my take :
16_cell_pos_5	PROS :
16_cell_pos_6	- Durability ;
16_cell_pos_7	this thing was built with the clumsy in mind
16_cell_pos_8	-LRB- like me -RRB- .
16_cell_pos_9	I must have dropped this thing a dozen times
16_cell_pos_10	and there 's barely a scratch .
16_cell_pos_11	- MP3 player ;
16_cell_pos_12	I agree
16_cell_pos_13	that the onboard 5MB of memory is a joke ,
16_cell_pos_14	but with the cost of TranshFlash memory
16_cell_pos_15	coming down
16_cell_pos_16	-LRB-
16_cell_pos_17	I bought my 512MB chip on eBay for $ 7.99 -RRB-
16_cell_pos_18	then
16_cell_pos_19	upgrading is easy and affordable .
16_cell_pos_20	That being said , the MP3 player is a feature
16_cell_pos_21	you will actually USE ,
16_cell_pos_22	and the sound quality is good .
16_cell_pos_23	I ` ve had no problem with playing my iTunes music
16_cell_pos_24	-LRB- as long as they ` re mp3 format AND no greater that 192Kbps in quality
16_cell_pos_25	then
16_cell_pos_26	it will play fine . -RRB-
16_cell_pos_27	\*\* Media Player defaults to wma and iTunes defaults to m4a formats -
16_cell_pos_28	you need
16_cell_pos_29	to convert them to mp3 or change the default in either program to rip to mp3 format
16_cell_pos_30	-LRB- you can change the default to mp3 in the settings menu -RRB-
16_cell_pos_31	"- Programmable "" smart keys "" ;"
16_cell_pos_32	I read
16_cell_pos_33	where one user complained
16_cell_pos_34	that the camera button was not on the side ,
16_cell_pos_35	it was the camera icon button on the front keypad .
16_cell_pos_36	He must not have known
16_cell_pos_37	"that you can reprogram all of the smart buttons from the "" Personalize "" menu ."
16_cell_pos_38	Not only that ,
16_cell_pos_39	but you can rearrange the menu buttons
16_cell_pos_40	and program most of the buttons on the face for frequently used apps .
16_cell_pos_41	It 's a handy little feature .
16_cell_pos_42	- Built in Bluetooth and EDGE technology .
16_cell_pos_43	You may not use these features out-of-the box ,
16_cell_pos_44	but they ` re for the time
16_cell_pos_45	when these technologies are more commonplace .
16_cell_pos_46	I use my Bluetooth for my wireless headset and for syncing and adding files
16_cell_pos_47	-LRB- mp3 's , pics , etc -RRB-
16_cell_pos_48	to my phone with my laptop .
16_cell_pos_49	- Quad-Band World Phone capable .
16_cell_pos_50	This phone works on 850 , 900 , 1800 , and 1900 GSM networks
16_cell_pos_51	-LRB- although that has not been personally tested -RRB- .
16_cell_pos_52	However ,
16_cell_pos_53	I will be traveling to Micronesia and the UK within the year
16_cell_pos_54	and I ` ll know for certain by then .
16_cell_pos_55	CONS :
16_cell_pos_56	- There 's a slight delay
16_cell_pos_57	when you answer a call -
16_cell_pos_58	"I usually have to say "" hello "" 2-3 times or wait a few seconds"
16_cell_pos_59	before I begin to speak .
16_cell_pos_60	I do n't know if this is a carrier problem or the phone .
16_cell_pos_61	-LRB- I use Cingular
16_cell_pos_62	prepaid -RRB- .
16_cell_pos_63	- The light stays on while
16_cell_pos_64	charging
16_cell_pos_65	-LRB- even
16_cell_pos_66	when the phone is powered off -RRB- .
16_cell_pos_67	It 's annoying .
16_cell_pos_68	- The onboard memory is a joke .
16_cell_pos_69	You really need to upgrade the memory if you want to do anything extra with the phone .
16_cell_pos_70	- It has a monochrome outer display
16_cell_pos_71	-LRB- full color inside -RRB- .
16_cell_pos_72	This does n't bother me at all ,
16_cell_pos_73	but it 's not as flashy as Razr or other phones .
16_cell_pos_74	OVERALL :
16_cell_pos_75	This is a great , durable little phone with handy features I think
16_cell_pos_76	people will actually use .
16_cell_pos_77	I ` ve read
16_cell_pos_78	where people complain about the picture quality -
16_cell_pos_79	but that 's what a digital camera is for .
16_cell_pos_80	If you want a good quality cell phone
16_cell_pos_81	that 's well designed , user friendly ,
16_cell_pos_82	and does n't look like a tricked-out teenager 's phone ,
16_cell_pos_83	then this is the phone for you .
