5_cell_neg_1	I  have  owned  Palm  organizers  since  the  days  of  the  original  Palm  Pilot 
5_cell_neg_2	and  have  loved  them 
5_cell_neg_3	-LRB- 
5_cell_neg_4	I  think 
5_cell_neg_5	I  had  three  different  models  over  the  years  -RRB-  . 
5_cell_neg_6	I  wanted  a  smart  phone 
5_cell_neg_7	so  I  could  check  my  email 
5_cell_neg_8	so  I  gravitated  to  the  Treo  680  so  I  could  stay  with  a  Palm  product  and  so  I  could  stay  with  my  current  mobile  provider  ,  Cingular  . 
5_cell_neg_9	Now  I  am 
5_cell_neg_10	counting  the  days 
5_cell_neg_11	until  my  2  year  commitment  ends 
5_cell_neg_12	so  I  can  punt  this  awful  ,  awful  product  . 
5_cell_neg_13	I  may  even  bite  the  bullet 
5_cell_neg_14	and  pay  off  my  commitment  early 
5_cell_neg_15	just  so  I  can  get  rid  of  it  . 
5_cell_neg_16	The  battery  problem  is  huge  . 
5_cell_neg_17	You  must  remember  to  stick  this  in  a  charger 
5_cell_neg_18	whenever  you  can  . 
5_cell_neg_19	If  you  forget  and  leave  it  in  your  pocket  overnight  then  it  will  be  dead  the  next  day  . 
5_cell_neg_20	I  have  turned  off  every  thing 
5_cell_neg_21	I  can  find  that  sucks  power 
5_cell_neg_22	and  it  still  drains  amazingly  fast  . 
5_cell_neg_23	It  wo  n't  even  last  a  day  if  you  make  very  many  calls  . 
5_cell_neg_24	The  reception  is  terrible  . 
5_cell_neg_25	I  `  ve  had  a  Cingular  phone  for  a  long  time  and  was  able  to  get  good  reception  over  most  of  So  . 
5_cell_neg_26	California 
5_cell_neg_27	-LRB-  except  for  my  house  of  course  -RRB-  . 
5_cell_neg_28	With  this  phone 
5_cell_neg_29	I  think 
5_cell_neg_30	you  have  to  be  right  underneath  an  antenna 
5_cell_neg_31	to  get  a  signal  . 
5_cell_neg_32	I  was  on  a  conference 
5_cell_neg_33	call  yesterday 
5_cell_neg_34	and  got  dropped  twice  . 
5_cell_neg_35	I  am  envious  everytime 
5_cell_neg_36	I  get  in  an  elevator  with  someone 
5_cell_neg_37	who  can  talk  on  their  cell  phone 
5_cell_neg_38	because  mine  will  freeze  up  any  time 
5_cell_neg_39	I  try  that  . 
5_cell_neg_40	Yes  , 
5_cell_neg_41	it  freezes  up  often  . 
5_cell_neg_42	The  only  way  I  have  found  to  unfreeze  it  is  to  take  out  the  battery 
5_cell_neg_43	and  let  it  do  a  hard  reboot  . 
5_cell_neg_44	The  versa  mail  program  that  it  came  with  from  Cingular  is  hard  to  work  with  . 
5_cell_neg_45	You  must  leave  your  work  computer  on  to  check  the  corporate  mail  . 
5_cell_neg_46	That  means  if  I  am  traveling  with  my  computer  , 
5_cell_neg_47	the  phone  's  corporate  mail  program  will  not  work  . 
5_cell_neg_48	It  often  will  not  sync  anyway  . 
5_cell_neg_49	I  do  n't  think  the  browser 
5_cell_neg_50	that  comes  with  the  phone  will  work  with  Java  ,  so  I  can  not  check  my  Yahoo  mail  either  . 
5_cell_neg_51	I  tried 
5_cell_neg_52	going  back  and  forth  to  the  pre-Java  version  of  Yahoo 
5_cell_neg_53	and  that  is  too  much  of  a  pain  . 
5_cell_neg_54	I  get  all  kinds  of  weird  messages  with  the  phone  . 
5_cell_neg_55	I  have  n't  ever  been  able  to  sync  up  the  Palm  features  because  of  some  legacy  files  from  my  previus  palm  software  ,  something 
5_cell_neg_56	that  never  happened 
5_cell_neg_57	when  I  upgraded  before  . 
5_cell_neg_58	Yes  , 
5_cell_neg_59	there  is  a  manual 
5_cell_neg_60	that  is  huge  . 
5_cell_neg_61	It  is  hard  to  use  on  line  so  I  guess 
5_cell_neg_62	I  need 
5_cell_neg_63	to  bite  the  bullet 
5_cell_neg_64	and  print  out  the  whole  thing 
5_cell_neg_65	and  then  take  a  week  of  vacation 
5_cell_neg_66	to  read  it 
5_cell_neg_67	and  see  if  I  can  make  any 
5_cell_neg_68	of  these  neat  functions  that  I  read  about  work  . 
5_cell_neg_69	Hardly  a  week  goes  by  that  I  do  n't  actively  think 
5_cell_neg_70	how  much  I  hate  this  phone  . 
5_cell_neg_71	I  actually  signed  on  to  Amazon  today 
5_cell_neg_72	just  to  write  this 
5_cell_neg_73	because  the  phone  was  n't  working  properly  today  . 
5_cell_neg_74	What  a  piece 
5_cell_neg_75	of  junk  ! 
7_cell_pos_1	Almost  2  years  ago  ,  my  fiance  and  I  signed  up  for  a  2-year  contract  with  Verizon  . 
7_cell_pos_2	We  got  a  great  deal  for  both  phones  . 
7_cell_pos_3	And  two  years  later  ,  both  phones  are  in  excellent  condition  with  very  few  scratches  and  dents  . 
7_cell_pos_4	This  is  a  great  phone  for  someone 
7_cell_pos_5	who  would  still  like  the  option  to  take  pictures  and  short  videos 
7_cell_pos_6	but  does  not  use  it  heavily  . 
7_cell_pos_7	I  have  38  pictures 
7_cell_pos_8	saved  on  my  phone  right  now  and  sending  picture  messages  is  extremely  easy  and  relatively  quick  with  this  phone  . 
7_cell_pos_9	Pros  : 
7_cell_pos_10	-  Sturdy  : 
7_cell_pos_11	It  's  not  as  thin  or  flimsy  as  some  of  the  newer  ultra-thin  phones  . 
7_cell_pos_12	I  have  dropped  my  phone 
7_cell_pos_13	so  many  times  and  my  phone  is  still  in  excellent  condition  . 
7_cell_pos_14	Another  thing  I  really  like  is  that 
7_cell_pos_15	when  you  drop  the  phone  , 
7_cell_pos_16	the  battery  does  n't  detach  easily  . 
7_cell_pos_17	Everytime  I  dropped  my  old  sony  ericsson  , 
7_cell_pos_18	the  battery  would  also  detach  and  I  'd  have  to  restart  my  phone  . 
7_cell_pos_19	-  Compact  : 
7_cell_pos_20	Though  it  is  on  the  thicker  side  ,  this  Samsung  is  very  compact  but  not  too  small 
7_cell_pos_21	where  you  fear 
7_cell_pos_22	loosing  it  . 
7_cell_pos_23	-  Good  Buttons  : 
7_cell_pos_24	For  those 
7_cell_pos_25	who  text  message  a  lot  ,  the  way  the  buttons  feel  can  really  make  a  difference  . 
7_cell_pos_26	The  buttons  on  this  phone  are  smooth  and  great  for  texting  . 
7_cell_pos_27	-  Menu  &  short  cuts  : 
7_cell_pos_28	On  the  side  of  the  phone  , 
7_cell_pos_29	you  can  adjust  your  ringtone  volume  by  simply  pressing  the  up  or  down  arrow  . 
7_cell_pos_30	If  you  hold  #  ,  your  phone  goes  into  vibrate  mode  . 
7_cell_pos_31	If  press  the  camera  button  on  the  right  hand  side  of  the  phone  the  camera  &  video  menu  pop  up  . 
7_cell_pos_32	You  can  also  choose 
7_cell_pos_33	which  shortcut 
7_cell_pos_34	you  'd  like 
7_cell_pos_35	"when  you  press  ""  up  ,  "" "
7_cell_pos_36	I  have  mine 
7_cell_pos_37	set  on  the  calendar  . 
7_cell_pos_38	-  Long  battery  life  : 
7_cell_pos_39	I  'm  not  one  to  spend  hours  on  my  cell  phone  , 
7_cell_pos_40	but  for  every  day  use  ,  this  phone  is  great  with  respect 
7_cell_pos_41	to  its  battery  life  . 
7_cell_pos_42	There  have  been  times 
7_cell_pos_43	when  I  forget  to  charge  my  phone 
7_cell_pos_44	and  go  2  days  without  charging 
7_cell_pos_45	and  it  is  still  close  to  fully 
7_cell_pos_46	charged  . 
7_cell_pos_47	-  Camera  has  flash  &  other  neat  options  : 
7_cell_pos_48	"You  can  also  adjust  the  brightness  level  ,  have  a  self  timer  ,  take  multiple  shots  ,  10  different  ""  fun  frames  ,  "" "
7_cell_pos_49	and  5  different  colortones  like  sepia  ,  monochrome 
7_cell_pos_50	-LRB-  black  &  white  and  negative  . 
7_cell_pos_51	-  Zoom  : 
7_cell_pos_52	You  can  zoom  upto  X4  . 
7_cell_pos_53	-  Phonebook  : 
7_cell_pos_54	Contacts  are  easy  to  access  and  it  's  easy  to  search  for  entries  . 
7_cell_pos_55	I  like  the  fact 
7_cell_pos_56	that  you  can  enter  multiple  numbers  under  one  name  . 
7_cell_pos_57	You  can  enter  that  persons  home  ,  mobile  ,  fax  ,  office  and  pager  number  . 
7_cell_pos_58	You  can  also  enter  an  alias  and  email  address  . 
7_cell_pos_59	You  can  assign  a  personalized  ring  tone  and  picture  and  you  can  categorize  your  contacts  in  different  groups  . 
7_cell_pos_60	-  Voice  commands  : 
7_cell_pos_61	By  pressing  &  holding  the  \*  button  ,  a  voice  command  menu  appears  . 
7_cell_pos_62	It  's  a  nice  feature 
7_cell_pos_63	but  is  not  something 
7_cell_pos_64	I  often  use  . 
7_cell_pos_65	-  Speed  dailing  : 
7_cell_pos_66	One  feature  that  I  do  take  advantage  of  is  speed  dailing  . 
7_cell_pos_67	It  's  nice  only  having  to  press  a  button 
7_cell_pos_68	to  instantly  connect  with  another  person  . 
7_cell_pos_69	-  Menu  styles  : 
7_cell_pos_70	There  are  2  different  menu  styles 
7_cell_pos_71	you  can  use  . 
7_cell_pos_72	I  like  the  nature  option 
7_cell_pos_73	which  has  cute  animation  for  each  subcategory 
7_cell_pos_74	you  scroll  through  . 
7_cell_pos_75	My  fiance  uses  the  icon  style 
7_cell_pos_76	which  is  a  more  simple  design  . 
7_cell_pos_77	-  Custom  welcome 
7_cell_pos_78	and  goodbye  screen  . 
7_cell_pos_79	Cons  : 
7_cell_pos_80	-  Video  quality  is  poor  and  very  pixelated  . 
7_cell_pos_81	My  phone  only  holds  2  15-second  videos  . 
7_cell_pos_82	-  Despite  the  generous  15  ring  tones  , 
7_cell_pos_83	it  's  hard  finding  a  ringtone 
7_cell_pos_84	that  does  n't  make 
7_cell_pos_85	you  want  to  pull  your  hair  out  . 
7_cell_pos_86	Out  of  the  15  ring  tones  , 
7_cell_pos_87	there  are  only  about  2  decent  ring  tones  . 
7_cell_pos_88	-  Antenna  : 
7_cell_pos_89	I  do  n't  use  the  antenna  very  often 
7_cell_pos_90	but  when  I  do  , 
7_cell_pos_91	it  has  a  hard  time  staying  up 
7_cell_pos_92	and  is  very  flimsy  . 
7_cell_pos_93	-  Picture  quality  is  not  the  best  . 
7_cell_pos_94	If  you  intend  on  taking  a  lot  of  pictures 
7_cell_pos_95	I  would  recommend  investing  in  a  better  picture  phone  . 
7_cell_pos_96	-  Does  not  have  V-Cast  . 
7_cell_pos_97	-  No  MP3  player  . 
7_cell_pos_98	Overall  : 
7_cell_pos_99	This  cell  phone  is  exactly 
7_cell_pos_100	that  ,  a  cell  phone  to  make  calls  . 
7_cell_pos_101	It  has  some  additional  features  like  picture  taking  and  video  and  organization  tools  like  the  phonebook  and  planner 
7_cell_pos_102	but  it  is  still  a  fairly  basic  phone  . 
19_kitchen_pos_1	This  is  the  best  ,  most  beloved  item  in  my  kitchen  !  !  ! 
19_kitchen_pos_2	I  only  wish  I  had  bought  the  grinder  and  all  the  different  cups 
19_kitchen_pos_3	-LRB- 
19_kitchen_pos_4	which  I  am  going  to  now  add  on  -RRB-  . 
19_kitchen_pos_5	I  read  some  of  the  other  reviews  --  and  at  first  I  was  also  disappointed  with  this  blender  . 
19_kitchen_pos_6	Now  that  I  have  learned 
19_kitchen_pos_7	how  to  use  it  , 
19_kitchen_pos_8	I  LOVE  IT  !  !  ! 
19_kitchen_pos_9	DO  NOT  put  Protein  powder  into  it  first  , 
19_kitchen_pos_10	it  will  get  stuck  in  the  bottom  of  the  cup 
19_kitchen_pos_11	which  you  invert  onto  the  blades 
19_kitchen_pos_12	-LRB- 
19_kitchen_pos_13	When  you  invert  it  , 
19_kitchen_pos_14	the  bottom  becomes  the  top  -RRB-  . 
19_kitchen_pos_15	If  you  put  liquid  in  first  and  then  the  powder 
19_kitchen_pos_16	there  's  no  problem  . 
19_kitchen_pos_17	You  have  to  learn 
19_kitchen_pos_18	how  to  use  it  . 
19_kitchen_pos_19	You  will  want  to  put  the  frozen  fruit  in  last  if  you  are  making  something  really  thick  . 
19_kitchen_pos_20	I  read  the  reviews  here 
19_kitchen_pos_21	before  I  bought  mine 
19_kitchen_pos_22	and  a  woman  said 
19_kitchen_pos_23	hers  was  junk 
19_kitchen_pos_24	but  I  went  ahead 
19_kitchen_pos_25	and  read  the  rest  of  the  reviews 
19_kitchen_pos_26	and  decided  to  buy  it  . 
19_kitchen_pos_27	If  mine  breaks  in  a  year  , 
19_kitchen_pos_28	it  will  have  been  well  worth  the  price  . 
19_kitchen_pos_29	I  use  it  every  day 
19_kitchen_pos_30	and  sometimes  three  times  a  day  . 
19_kitchen_pos_31	On  a  hot  day 
19_kitchen_pos_32	when  I  want  something  slushy  and  cold  , 
19_kitchen_pos_33	I  `  ll  put  in  orange  juice  with  some  strawberries  and  ice  -- 
19_kitchen_pos_34	in  a  flash 
19_kitchen_pos_35	you  have  a  refreshing  drink  . 
19_kitchen_pos_36	It  's  fabulous  . 
19_kitchen_pos_37	I  could  use  my  Cuisinart  , 
19_kitchen_pos_38	but  this  blender  is  so  easy  and  quiet  by  comparison  . 
19_kitchen_pos_39	There  are  no  buttons 
19_kitchen_pos_40	to  push  , 
19_kitchen_pos_41	you  just  fill  the  cup  with  your  juice 
19_kitchen_pos_42	-LRB-  I  often  add  protein  powder  -RRB- 
19_kitchen_pos_43	and  something  frozen 
19_kitchen_pos_44	-LRB-  Ice  or  frozen  fruit  -RRB- 
19_kitchen_pos_45	and  screw  on  the  lid 
19_kitchen_pos_46	-LRB- 
19_kitchen_pos_47	which  have  blades  in  it  -RRB- 
19_kitchen_pos_48	and  put  it  on  the  blending  base  and  twist  . 
19_kitchen_pos_49	You  can  either  twist  and  pusle  it  ,  or  twist 
19_kitchen_pos_50	and  leave  it  to  blend  on  its  own  . 
19_kitchen_pos_51	Then  you  take  the  lid  off  ,  rinse  , 
19_kitchen_pos_52	and  that  's  it  . 
19_kitchen_pos_53	I  love  hummus 
19_kitchen_pos_54	and  I  will  never  make  it  in  the  blender 
19_kitchen_pos_55	because  you  have  to  dig  it  out 
19_kitchen_pos_56	and  most  of  it  gets  left  behind  . 
19_kitchen_pos_57	With  this  gadget  , 
19_kitchen_pos_58	you  fill  the  cup  ,  blend  it  , 
19_kitchen_pos_59	then  screw  off  the  blade  lid  ,  screw  on  the  refrigerator  lid  ,  and 
19_kitchen_pos_60	that  's  it  . 
19_kitchen_pos_61	Nothing  to  scrape  ,  just  put  it  in  the  refrigerator  . 
19_kitchen_pos_62	-LRB-  Oh  yes  , 
19_kitchen_pos_63	you  do  have  to  rinse  off  the  blade  lid  ,  that  's  the  whole  clean-up  -RRB-  . 
19_kitchen_pos_64	If  you  like  frozen  drinks  or  sauces  you  blend  ,  this  is  a  great  gadget  !  !  ! 
19_kitchen_pos_65	I  live  in  two  places 
19_kitchen_pos_66	and  I  am  getting  another  one  for  the  other  place  , 
19_kitchen_pos_67	but  I  'm  buying  the  complete  set  this  time 
5_kitchen_neg_1	Amazing 
5_kitchen_neg_2	that  in  2005 
5_kitchen_neg_3	you  can  read  review 
5_kitchen_neg_4	after  review  on  Amazon  about  the  poor  quality  of  almost  every  toaster 
5_kitchen_neg_5	offered  . 
5_kitchen_neg_6	We  hoped  this  one  would  be  an  exception  . 
5_kitchen_neg_7	It  was  , 
5_kitchen_neg_8	but  only  in  that  it  may  be  the  poorest  of  them  all  . 
5_kitchen_neg_9	Ours  buzzed  loudly  whenever  in  use  . 
5_kitchen_neg_10	Never  had  a  toaster  buzz  before  . 
5_kitchen_neg_11	We  toast  bread  at  least  twice  a  day  , 
5_kitchen_neg_12	and  the  toasting  performance  of  this  unit  is  horrible  . 
5_kitchen_neg_13	It  has  no  bagel  setting 
5_kitchen_neg_14	-LRB- 
5_kitchen_neg_15	which  toasts  the  cut  side  more  than  the  crust  side  -RRB-  , 
5_kitchen_neg_16	so  we  ended  up  with  one  side  burnt  and  the  other  barely 
5_kitchen_neg_17	starting  to  toast  . 
5_kitchen_neg_18	What  's  more  , 
5_kitchen_neg_19	it  toasts  completely  unevenly  . 
5_kitchen_neg_20	One  corner  of  toast  will  be  blackened 
5_kitchen_neg_21	while  the  far  corner  will  barely  be  tanned  . 
5_kitchen_neg_22	And  it  's  really  annoying 
5_kitchen_neg_23	when  a  4-slice  toaster  does  not  allow  you  to  operate  the  heating  elements  independently  . 
5_kitchen_neg_24	As  far  as  looks  go  , 
5_kitchen_neg_25	De  '  Longhi  did  just  as  bad  a  job  . 
5_kitchen_neg_26	The  photos  look  cool  , 
5_kitchen_neg_27	"but  the  crumb  tray  this  unit  ""  sits  "" "
5_kitchen_neg_28	upon  is  actually  wider  than  the  unit 
5_kitchen_neg_29	itself  , 
5_kitchen_neg_30	so  there  is  a  big  uneven  gap  at  the  seam  . 
5_kitchen_neg_31	It  's  the  lower  line 
5_kitchen_neg_32	you  see  in  the  photos  -- 
5_kitchen_neg_33	but  they  make 
5_kitchen_neg_34	it  look  real  nice  for  that  ! 
5_kitchen_neg_35	What  you  do  n't  see  is  the  other  side  of  the  toaster 
5_kitchen_neg_36	where  the  bottom  crumb  tray  will  be  sticking  out  several  MM  from  the  side  of  the  toaster  rather  than  being  flush 
5_kitchen_neg_37	as  shown  . 
5_kitchen_neg_38	This  makes  it  look  broken  ,  like  two  pieces  of  something 
5_kitchen_neg_39	that  no  longer  fit  together  . 
5_kitchen_neg_40	If  De  '  Longhi  had  spent  even  a  second  thinking  about  this  , 
5_kitchen_neg_41	they  would  have  done  the  opposite  : 
5_kitchen_neg_42	The  bottom  tray  should  be  slightly  smaller  than  the  toasting  unit  , 
5_kitchen_neg_43	which  would  give  the  unit  a  seamless  look  rather  than  a  busted  look  . 
5_kitchen_neg_44	-LRB-  We  even  went  to  a  store 
5_kitchen_neg_45	yes  ,  a  real  store 
5_kitchen_neg_46	to  confirm 
5_kitchen_neg_47	that  they  are  all  like  this  , 
5_kitchen_neg_48	and  they  are  .  -RRB- 
5_kitchen_neg_49	Also  ,  the  bread  warming  rack  is  another  poorly  designed  element  . 
5_kitchen_neg_50	There  are  4  tiny  plastic  feet 
5_kitchen_neg_51	inserted  into  the  four  metal  posts  of  the  rack  so  it  does  n't  scratch  the  metal  surface  of  the  toaster  . 
5_kitchen_neg_52	However  , 
5_kitchen_neg_53	two  of  the  feet  had  already  fallen  out  during  shipping  , 
5_kitchen_neg_54	and  though  they  slipped  right  back  in  ,  all  four  of  the  tiny  feet  can  easily  be  removed  or  fall  out 
5_kitchen_neg_55	-LRB-  only  friction  holds  them  in  -RRB- 
5_kitchen_neg_56	and 
5_kitchen_neg_57	you  WILL  loose  them  very  quickly  --  especially  if  you  ever  wash  the  rack  . 
5_kitchen_neg_58	We  `  re  happy  to  pay  extra  for  a  quality  item  --  even  a  toaster  -- 
5_kitchen_neg_59	but  we  expect  something  in  return  besides  utter  dissapointment  . 
5_kitchen_neg_60	Final  advice  : 
5_kitchen_neg_61	Stick  to  the  $  20  toasters  with  functions  such  as  bagel  ,  defrost  ,  and  dual  controls  . 
5_kitchen_neg_62	If  it  's  ugly  ,  keep 
5_kitchen_neg_63	it  under  the  sink 
5_kitchen_neg_64	and  only  take  it  out 
5_kitchen_neg_65	when  you  use  it  . 
5_kitchen_neg_66	This  one  looks  broken  ,  performs  poorly  ,  and  costs  a  lot  of  money  . 
5_kitchen_neg_67	If  you  do  buy  this  model  , 
5_kitchen_neg_68	maybe  you  `  ll  get  ours  .  .  . 
5_kitchen_neg_69	we  returned  it 
5_gourmet_pos_1	One  day  , 
5_gourmet_pos_2	while  my  cell  phone  was  n't  working 
5_gourmet_pos_3	-LRB-  as  usual  -RRB- 
5_gourmet_pos_4	I  decided  to  see  what  would  happen  if  I  wrapped  the  antennae  in  a  bunch  of  Dole  USA  #  1 
5_gourmet_pos_5	Iceberg  Lettuce  ,  1  ct  ! 
5_gourmet_pos_6	Of  course  , 
5_gourmet_pos_7	you  would  never  believe 
5_gourmet_pos_8	me  in  a  trillion  zillion  years  , 
5_gourmet_pos_9	but  it  worked  better  ! 
5_gourmet_pos_10	Now  I  go  to  high  level  executive  functions  with  a  Dole  USA  #  1  Iceberg  Lettuce  ,  1  ct 
5_gourmet_pos_11	attached  to  my  ear  , 
5_gourmet_pos_12	and  people  thing 
5_gourmet_pos_13	I  'm  strange  .  .  . 
5_gourmet_pos_14	but  the  heck  with  them  . 
5_gourmet_pos_15	Now  I  have  better  coverage  than  they  do  ! 
5_gourmet_pos_16	And  is  n't  that 
5_gourmet_pos_17	what  it  's  all  about  ?

17_gourmet_neg_1	This  carafe  was  initially  perfect  . 
17_gourmet_neg_2	The  design  is  attractive  and  simple  , 
17_gourmet_neg_3	and  it  fits  well  in  my  bag  in  the  mornings  . 
17_gourmet_neg_4	The  problem  then  began  that 
17_gourmet_neg_5	keeping  liquids  boiling  hot  would  cause  it  to  explode  after  being  jostled  in  on  my  morning  commute  . 
17_gourmet_neg_6	I  attempted  to  remedy  this  by  cooling  my  morning  coffee  or  tea  in  the  morning  , 
17_gourmet_neg_7	although  I  felt 
17_gourmet_neg_8	this  was  partially  defeating  the  purpose  of  bringing  in  my  own  coffee  or  tea  . 
17_gourmet_neg_9	Then  it  became  an  issue 
17_gourmet_neg_10	that  the  liquid  would  either  leak  or  shoot  out  of  the  carafe 
17_gourmet_neg_11	after  being  turned  the  slightest  direction  other  than  straight  up  . 
17_gourmet_neg_12	I  'd  suggest 
17_gourmet_neg_13	saving  yourself  the  trouble  and  tea  stained  clothes  by  buying  a  different  carafe  altogether 
16_cell_neg_1	I  got  this  phone  basically  for  free  , 
16_cell_neg_2	but  even  taking  that  into  account  , 
16_cell_neg_3	I  'm  pretty  disappointed  with  the  phone  . 
16_cell_neg_4	This  is  my  first  Samsung 
16_cell_neg_5	and  , 
16_cell_neg_6	I  'm  pretty  sure  ,  my  last  one  ! 
16_cell_neg_7	I  owned  a  Nokia  before 
16_cell_neg_8	and  I  regret 
16_cell_neg_9	"that  I  ""  betrayed  "" "
16_cell_neg_10	it  . 
16_cell_neg_11	From  now  I  would  n't  get  anything  besides  Nokia  and  in  the  worst  case  maybe  Sony-Ericsson  . 
16_cell_neg_12	"So  here  is  a  short  list  of  those  ""  little  things  "" "
16_cell_neg_13	that  make  your  life  ,  with  this  phone 
16_cell_neg_14	-LRB-  and  it  's  combination  with  T-Mobile  -RRB-  , 
16_cell_neg_15	annoying  : 
16_cell_neg_16	-  the  keys  are  not  comfortable  to  use  . 
16_cell_neg_17	-  it  's  not  really  comfortable  to  open\/close  the  slider 
16_cell_neg_18	and  to  make 
16_cell_neg_19	it  easier 
16_cell_neg_20	you  have  to  put  your  thumb  on  the  screen 
16_cell_neg_21	which  leaves  is  greasy  all  the  time  . 
16_cell_neg_22	-  putting  a  comma  , 
16_cell_neg_23	while  writing  a  text  message  ,  capitalizes  the  next  word  - 
16_cell_neg_24	what  is  the  logic  in  that  ?  ! 
16_cell_neg_25	-LRB-  it  annoys  me 
16_cell_neg_26	because  i  do  use  text  messages  a  lot  -RRB- 
16_cell_neg_27	-  you  ca  n't  set  the  camera  shutter  to  be  silent  .  .  . 
16_cell_neg_28	-  you  can  only  save  1  phone  type  for  each  category  - 
16_cell_neg_29	what  if  the  person  has  2  business  phones  .  .  . 
16_cell_neg_30	-  you  can  not  choose  the  e-mail  address  of  a  person  from  the  contact  list 
16_cell_neg_31	when  you  want  to  send  a  picture  message  to  an  e-mail  address  . 
16_cell_neg_32	And  there  is  a  lot  more  of  those  little  illogical  things 
16_cell_neg_33	that  were  just  not  thought  through  , 
16_cell_neg_34	like  it  would  `  ve  been  in  a  Nokia 
16_cell_neg_35	-LRB-  even  in  a  model  5  years  old  !  -RRB- 
16_cell_neg_36	Oh  yeah  , 
16_cell_neg_37	"and  T-Mobile  really  ""  contributed  ""  to  the  ""  greatness  "" "
16_cell_neg_38	of  this  phone  , 
16_cell_neg_39	removing  some  of  the  features  and  limiting  others  ,  like  setting  your  mp3  as  a  ringtone 
16_cell_neg_40	-LRB-  although  ,  there  is  an  easy  hack  around  it  : 
16_cell_neg_41	just  change  the  extension  from  .  mp3  to  .3  gp 
16_cell_pos_1	I  bought  my  V360  on  eBay 
16_cell_pos_2	and  it  was  sold  unlocked\/unbranded 
16_cell_pos_3	and  it  was  of  the  quad-band  variety  . 
16_cell_pos_4	Here  's  my  take  : 
16_cell_pos_5	PROS  : 
16_cell_pos_6	-  Durability  ; 
16_cell_pos_7	this  thing  was  built  with  the  clumsy  in  mind 
16_cell_pos_8	-LRB-  like  me  -RRB-  . 
16_cell_pos_9	I  must  have  dropped  this  thing  a  dozen  times 
16_cell_pos_10	and  there  's  barely  a  scratch  . 
16_cell_pos_11	-  MP3  player  ; 
16_cell_pos_12	I  agree 
16_cell_pos_13	that  the  onboard  5MB  of  memory  is  a  joke  , 
16_cell_pos_14	but  with  the  cost  of  TranshFlash  memory 
16_cell_pos_15	coming  down 
16_cell_pos_16	-LRB- 
16_cell_pos_17	I  bought  my  512MB  chip  on  eBay  for  $  7.99  -RRB- 
16_cell_pos_18	then 
16_cell_pos_19	upgrading  is  easy  and  affordable  . 
16_cell_pos_20	That  being  said  ,  the  MP3  player  is  a  feature 
16_cell_pos_21	you  will  actually  USE  , 
16_cell_pos_22	and  the  sound  quality  is  good  . 
16_cell_pos_23	I  `  ve  had  no  problem  with  playing  my  iTunes  music 
16_cell_pos_24	-LRB-  as  long  as  they  `  re  mp3  format  AND  no  greater  that  192Kbps  in  quality 
16_cell_pos_25	then 
16_cell_pos_26	it  will  play  fine  .  -RRB- 
16_cell_pos_27	\*\*  Media  Player  defaults  to  wma  and  iTunes  defaults  to  m4a  formats  - 
16_cell_pos_28	you  need 
16_cell_pos_29	to  convert  them  to  mp3  or  change  the  default  in  either  program  to  rip  to  mp3  format 
16_cell_pos_30	-LRB-  you  can  change  the  default  to  mp3  in  the  settings  menu  -RRB- 
16_cell_pos_31	"-  Programmable  ""  smart  keys  ""  ; "
16_cell_pos_32	I  read 
16_cell_pos_33	where  one  user  complained 
16_cell_pos_34	that  the  camera  button  was  not  on  the  side  , 
16_cell_pos_35	it  was  the  camera  icon  button  on  the  front  keypad  . 
16_cell_pos_36	He  must  not  have  known 
16_cell_pos_37	"that  you  can  reprogram  all  of  the  smart  buttons  from  the  ""  Personalize  ""  menu  . "
16_cell_pos_38	Not  only  that  , 
16_cell_pos_39	but  you  can  rearrange  the  menu  buttons 
16_cell_pos_40	and  program  most  of  the  buttons  on  the  face  for  frequently  used  apps  . 
16_cell_pos_41	It  's  a  handy  little  feature  . 
16_cell_pos_42	-  Built  in  Bluetooth  and  EDGE  technology  . 
16_cell_pos_43	You  may  not  use  these  features  out-of-the  box  , 
16_cell_pos_44	but  they  `  re  for  the  time 
16_cell_pos_45	when  these  technologies  are  more  commonplace  . 
16_cell_pos_46	I  use  my  Bluetooth  for  my  wireless  headset  and  for  syncing  and  adding  files 
16_cell_pos_47	-LRB-  mp3  's  ,  pics  ,  etc  -RRB- 
16_cell_pos_48	to  my  phone  with  my  laptop  . 
16_cell_pos_49	-  Quad-Band  World  Phone  capable  . 
16_cell_pos_50	This  phone  works  on  850  ,  900  ,  1800  ,  and  1900  GSM  networks 
16_cell_pos_51	-LRB-  although  that  has  not  been  personally  tested  -RRB-  . 
16_cell_pos_52	However  , 
16_cell_pos_53	I  will  be  traveling  to  Micronesia  and  the  UK  within  the  year 
16_cell_pos_54	and  I  `  ll  know  for  certain  by  then  . 
16_cell_pos_55	CONS  : 
16_cell_pos_56	-  There  's  a  slight  delay 
16_cell_pos_57	when  you  answer  a  call  - 
16_cell_pos_58	"I  usually  have  to  say  ""  hello  ""  2-3  times  or  wait  a  few  seconds "
16_cell_pos_59	before  I  begin  to  speak  . 
16_cell_pos_60	I  do  n't  know  if  this  is  a  carrier  problem  or  the  phone  . 
16_cell_pos_61	-LRB-  I  use  Cingular 
16_cell_pos_62	prepaid  -RRB-  . 
16_cell_pos_63	-  The  light  stays  on  while 
16_cell_pos_64	charging 
16_cell_pos_65	-LRB-  even 
16_cell_pos_66	when  the  phone  is  powered  off  -RRB-  . 
16_cell_pos_67	It  's  annoying  . 
16_cell_pos_68	-  The  onboard  memory  is  a  joke  . 
16_cell_pos_69	You  really  need  to  upgrade  the  memory  if  you  want  to  do  anything  extra  with  the  phone  . 
16_cell_pos_70	-  It  has  a  monochrome  outer  display 
16_cell_pos_71	-LRB-  full  color  inside  -RRB-  . 
16_cell_pos_72	This  does  n't  bother  me  at  all  , 
16_cell_pos_73	but  it  's  not  as  flashy  as  Razr  or  other  phones  . 
16_cell_pos_74	OVERALL  : 
16_cell_pos_75	This  is  a  great  ,  durable  little  phone  with  handy  features  I  think 
16_cell_pos_76	people  will  actually  use  . 
16_cell_pos_77	I  `  ve  read 
16_cell_pos_78	where  people  complain  about  the  picture  quality  - 
16_cell_pos_79	but  that  's  what  a  digital  camera  is  for  . 
16_cell_pos_80	If  you  want  a  good  quality  cell  phone 
16_cell_pos_81	that  's  well  designed  ,  user  friendly  , 
16_cell_pos_82	and  does  n't  look  like  a  tricked-out  teenager  's  phone  , 
16_cell_pos_83	then  this  is  the  phone  for  you  . 
7_kitchen_pos_1	I  read  the  reviews 
7_kitchen_pos_2	before  I  purchased  this  machine  . 
7_kitchen_pos_3	I  know  from  experience  that  reviews  are  extremely  subjective  and  often  times  people  misuse  the  appliance  or  simply  expect  more  than  a  machine  is  capable  of  . 
7_kitchen_pos_4	So  with  this  in  mind 
7_kitchen_pos_5	I  will  put  in  my  2  cents  . 
7_kitchen_pos_6	I  have  had  my  machine  for  two  months  and  I  use  it  about  4  times  a  week  on  a  200  square  foot  vinyl  kitchen  floor  that  accomodates  two  adults  ,  a  4  year  old 
7_kitchen_pos_7	and  two  dogs  . 
7_kitchen_pos_8	Generally  it  works  pretty  well  and  is  much  more  convenient  than  a  regular  mop  and  bucket  . 
7_kitchen_pos_9	You  must  remember  that  this  is  a  low  cost  residential  machine 
7_kitchen_pos_10	and  as  such  will  not  replace  the  suction  and  scrubbing  power  of  a  serious  vacuum  and  elbow  grease  . 
7_kitchen_pos_11	The  machine  is  set  up  to  auto-shut  off 
7_kitchen_pos_12	if  you  move  the  machine  quickly  or  drop  it  down  low  . 
7_kitchen_pos_13	I  agree  with  with  the  other  writers  about  the  poor  suction  capability 
7_kitchen_pos_14	but  you  must  consider  the  overall  design  of  the  machine  . 
7_kitchen_pos_15	A  powerful  adjustable  head  machine 
7_kitchen_pos_16	that  would  pick  up  more  than  dog  hair  and  dust  would  be  cost  prohibitive  . 
7_kitchen_pos_17	I  see 
7_kitchen_pos_18	what  Hoover  was  trying  to  do  with  this  machine  . 
7_kitchen_pos_19	They  were  trying  to  accomodate  our  scrubbing 
7_kitchen_pos_20	and  vacuuming  needs  in  one  cost  effective  machine  . 
7_kitchen_pos_21	They  gave  it  a  good  shot 
7_kitchen_pos_22	but  for  all  of  us  clean-freaks  this  machine  does  n't  quite  hit  the  mark  . 
7_kitchen_pos_23	The  water\/cleaning  solution  section  is  ,  in  my  humble  opinion  ,  to  small  . 
7_kitchen_pos_24	I  run  out  of  water  quickly 
7_kitchen_pos_25	and  I  have  a  very  small  kitchen  . 
7_kitchen_pos_26	But  the  good  news  is  that  my  kitchen  is  so  small 
7_kitchen_pos_27	I  can  take  three  steps  over  to  the  sink 
7_kitchen_pos_28	and  fill  it  up  . 
7_kitchen_pos_29	:  -RRB- 
7_kitchen_pos_30	One  more  comment 
7_kitchen_pos_31	before  I  give  my  final  review  .  .  . 
7_kitchen_pos_32	remember  to  follow  the  instructions 
7_kitchen_pos_33	and  use  ONLY 
7_kitchen_pos_34	the  kind  of  cleaners  Hoover  recommends  . 
7_kitchen_pos_35	There  's  a  reason  for  this  . 
7_kitchen_pos_36	If  you  use  regular  household  cleaners 
7_kitchen_pos_37	that  cut  crease  you  will  damage  your  machine 
7_kitchen_pos_38	and  it  will  most  certainly  leak  and  die  ! 
7_kitchen_pos_39	The  grease  cutting  agents  in  regular  household  cleaners  and  soaps  strip  the  bearings 
7_kitchen_pos_40	and  fry  the  gaskets  . 
7_kitchen_pos_41	So  my  final  opinion  is  this  . 
7_kitchen_pos_42	If  you  have  a  relatively  small  space 
7_kitchen_pos_43	and  need  a  daily  quick  scrub 
7_kitchen_pos_44	it  's  a  great  time  saver  . 
7_kitchen_pos_45	It  's  a  good  overall  cleaner  if  you  need  a  quick  vac-up  of  dog  hair  ,  scrub  and  mop  . 
7_kitchen_pos_46	Any  more  heavy  duty  than  that 
7_kitchen_pos_47	and  you  are  back  to  the  good  old  vacuum  attachment  ,  mop  and  bucket  routine  . 
7_kitchen_pos_48	If  you  are  a  cleanfreak  ,  like  me  , 
7_kitchen_pos_49	you  know  that  nothing  replaces  a  good  old  fashioned  hand-and-knees  scrub  . 
7_kitchen_pos_50	No  machine  will  ever  leave  you  satisfied  . 
7_kitchen_pos_51	This  machine  was  definately  NOT  made  for  heavy  duty  cleaning 
7_kitchen_pos_52	but  for  light  daily  use 
7_kitchen_pos_53	it  's  great  . 
7_kitchen_pos_54	I  am 
7_kitchen_pos_55	giving  this  machine  4  stars 
7_kitchen_pos_56	because  I  think 
7_kitchen_pos_57	it  does  what  it  was  designed  to  do  .  .  .  light  cleaning  . 
7_kitchen_pos_58	I  would  have  given  it  5  stars 
7_kitchen_pos_59	if  the  cleaning  solution  bucket  was  larger 
7_kitchen_pos_60	and  the  cut  off  mechanism  was  a  little  more  liberal  and  a  little  more  suction  power 
7_kitchen_pos_61	would  have  been  nice  . 
7_kitchen_pos_62	When  Hoover  finally  comes  up  with  a  heavy  duty  scrubber  with  the  suction  power  of  a  regular  vacuum  , 
7_kitchen_pos_63	scrubbing  power  of  my  own  elbow  and  ability  to  get  into  corners  and  baseboards  I  `  ll  be  all  over  it  ! 
7_kitchen_pos_64	Until  then  , 
7_kitchen_pos_65	I  `  ll  settle  for  a  daily  scrub  with  this  machine  and  a  good  hand  scrub  once  a  month  . 
15_kitchen_neg_1	We  bought  a  well-reviewed  carpet  vacuum  from  Amazon  last  year  , 
15_kitchen_neg_2	and  absolutely  love  it  . 
15_kitchen_neg_3	After  that  positive  experience  , 
15_kitchen_neg_4	we  were  looking  for  something  for  our  kitchen  ,  bathroom  and  hallway  floors 
15_kitchen_neg_5	and  came  upon  this  cleaner  . 
15_kitchen_neg_6	Starting  with  the  dry  vac  part  , 
15_kitchen_neg_7	that 
15_kitchen_neg_8	seems 
15_kitchen_neg_9	to  get  smallish  pieces  of  dirt  fine  ,  but  anything  Cheerio  sized  or  larger  it  pushes  around  on  the  floor  unless  you  lean  the  vacuum  back  . 
15_kitchen_neg_10	Which  would  be  fine  , 
15_kitchen_neg_11	but  if  you  lean  it  back  too  far  , 
15_kitchen_neg_12	there  is  a  suction  filter  thing 
15_kitchen_neg_13	-LRB-  made 
15_kitchen_neg_14	for  the  wet  vac  part  -RRB- 
15_kitchen_neg_15	that  sticks  and  you  have  to  turn  off  the  vacuum 
15_kitchen_neg_16	and  wait  about  10  seconds  for  the  suction 
15_kitchen_neg_17	to  release  that  piece 
15_kitchen_neg_18	before  you  can  continue  . 
15_kitchen_neg_19	Anyway  , 
15_kitchen_neg_20	the  small  dirt  and  dust  are  really  picked  up  quite  well  , 
15_kitchen_neg_21	but  if  any  of  you 
15_kitchen_neg_22	have  small  children 
15_kitchen_neg_23	-LRB-  we  have  3  boys  under  6  -RRB-  , 
15_kitchen_neg_24	do  n't  have  any  expectations  of  this  getting  up  mealtime  messes  . 
15_kitchen_neg_25	Now  ,  onto  the  wet  vac  part  , 
15_kitchen_neg_26	which  was  the  main  reason 
15_kitchen_neg_27	we  got  this  . 
15_kitchen_neg_28	Very  disappointing  . 
15_kitchen_neg_29	We  used  the  included  cleaner  ,  warm  tap  water  ,  etc  as  the  directions  indicated  , 
15_kitchen_neg_30	and  both  my  wife  and  I  swear  the  floor  is  no  cleaner  than  when  we  started  . 
15_kitchen_neg_31	It  does  n't  look  cleaner  ,  shine  more  or  even  have  a  nice  smell 
15_kitchen_neg_32	that  we  could  even  close  our  eyes  and  pretend 
15_kitchen_neg_33	it  was  clean  . 
15_kitchen_neg_34	Spills  or  stains  that  normally  take  1-3  passes  with  a  mop  are  taking  8-12  passes  with  this  machine  . 
15_kitchen_neg_35	We  bought  this  to  save  time  and\/or  get  cleaner  floors  , 
15_kitchen_neg_36	and  I  can  honestly  say 
15_kitchen_neg_37	that  this  machine  did  not  do  either  . 
15_kitchen_neg_38	As  briefly  noted  above  , 
15_kitchen_neg_39	if  you  have  children  ,  do  not  expect  clean  floors  out  of  this  , 
15_kitchen_neg_40	and  I  ca  n't  recommend  this  at  all  . 
15_kitchen_neg_41	This  product  may  be  suitable  for  people 
15_kitchen_neg_42	who  have  no  children  ,  no  pets  and  only  small  dust  particles  and  light  traffic  ; 
15_kitchen_neg_43	I  just  know  this  is  n't  our  house

2_gourmet_pos_14	"The  ""  I  Love  You  ""  chocolate  with  dreamy  lemon  filling  embodies  this  sentiment  . "

2_gourmet_pos_17	specific  flavors  will  stand  out  as  favorites  . 
2_gourmet_pos_18	Here  are  my  favorite  creamy  fillings  -LRB-  ganache  and  butter  cream  -RRB-

2_gourmet_pos_30	they  come  in  a  variety  of  flavors  . 
2_gourmet_pos_31	The  milk  chocolate  and  cherry  filling  is  like  Claude  Debussy  's  R  verie  . 
2_gourmet_pos_32	It  is  difficult  to  describe  besides  saying 
2_gourmet_pos_33	it  is  like  a  delicate  cherry  icing

1_gourmet_neg_1	I  really  do  like  my  Senseo  coffee  maker  . 
1_gourmet_neg_2	I  ,  like  others 
1_gourmet_neg_3	who  have  reviewed  the  Kona  Pods  here  ,  was  always  searching  for  a  better  tasting  coffee  pod  to  use  in  the  machine  . 
1_gourmet_neg_4	I  was  excited  to  see 
1_gourmet_neg_5	that  Kona  now  made  pods 
1_gourmet_neg_6	and  was  also  happy  to  see 
1_gourmet_neg_7	that  they  had  a  pod 
1_gourmet_neg_8	that  was  a  '  2  cup  style  '  . 
1_gourmet_neg_9	I  have  not  found  it  to  be  a  huge  deal 
1_gourmet_neg_10	to  use  2  smaller  ' 
1_gourmet_neg_11	1  cup  '  size  pods  , 
1_gourmet_neg_12	but  it  sounded  nice  to  be  able  to  just  put  one  large  pod  in  the  machine  instead  of  2  smaller  one  . 
1_gourmet_neg_13	After  reading  some  of  the  reviews  here  , 
1_gourmet_neg_14	I  could  not  figure  out 
1_gourmet_neg_15	what  some  of  the  reviewers  meant  by  the  Kona  pods 
1_gourmet_neg_16	making  different  amount  of  coffee  per  cup  each  time  or  how  the  coffee  could  be  strange  and  undrinkable  . 
1_gourmet_neg_17	It  just  did  n't  make  sense  . 
1_gourmet_neg_18	Well  , 
1_gourmet_neg_19	it  still  does  n't  make  sense  , 
1_gourmet_neg_20	but  it  certainly  happened  with  the  coffee 
1_gourmet_neg_21	I  made  using  the  Kona  pods  also  . 
1_gourmet_neg_22	My  results  were  overall  poor  and  it  was  very  disappointing  as  the  Kona  pods  cost  a  lot  more  than  Folgers  or  other  pod  brands  that  I  can  buy  locally  . 
1_gourmet_neg_23	The  first  thing  I  noticed  was  that  the  coffee  in  the  2  cup  sized  Kona  pods  is  packed  in  much 
1_gourmet_neg_24	more  tightly  than  in  any  other  pod 
1_gourmet_neg_25	I  have  ever  used  in  my  Senseo  . 
1_gourmet_neg_26	The  instructions  for  the  Kona  pods  say 
1_gourmet_neg_27	to  wiggle  the  pods  to  break  up  the  coffee  before  inserting  into  the  machine  . 
1_gourmet_neg_28	The  Kona  pods  feel  very  hard 
1_gourmet_neg_29	when  taken  out  of  their  package  . 
1_gourmet_neg_30	I  always  wiggled  and  jiggled  the  pods  for  about  10  seconds 
1_gourmet_neg_31	before  putting  them  in  the  Senseo  . 
1_gourmet_neg_32	After  my  problems  with  the  Kona  pods  , 
1_gourmet_neg_33	my  husband  decided  that  I  was  not  '  wiggling  ' 
1_gourmet_neg_34	them  enough  . 
1_gourmet_neg_35	He  promptly  wiggled  one  to  the  point  that  it  broke  open  . 
1_gourmet_neg_36	So  , 
1_gourmet_neg_37	there  is  just  so  much 
1_gourmet_neg_38	that  can  be  done  to  the  pod 
1_gourmet_neg_39	before  putting  it  in  the  machine  . 
1_gourmet_neg_40	The  first  thing  that  I  noticed  was  that  the  amount  of  coffee 
1_gourmet_neg_41	brewed 
1_gourmet_neg_42	when  using  the  Kona  pod  was  quite  a  bit  less  than  when  using  2  smaller  pods  . 
1_gourmet_neg_43	That  did  not  make  much  sense  , 
1_gourmet_neg_44	but  after  several  cups  of  Kona  , 
1_gourmet_neg_45	it  was  obvious 
1_gourmet_neg_46	that  there  was  never  the  amount  of  coffee 
1_gourmet_neg_47	coming  out  as  before  when  using  2  small  one  cup  pods  . 
1_gourmet_neg_48	The  best  I  can  figure  out  is  that  the  Kona  pods 
1_gourmet_neg_49	themselves  seem  to  '  hold  '  a  lot  more  water  . 
1_gourmet_neg_50	There  is  more  water 
1_gourmet_neg_51	that  remains  in  the  pod  itself 
1_gourmet_neg_52	after  the  brewing  is  done  . 
1_gourmet_neg_53	The  pod  itself  is  heavier 
1_gourmet_neg_54	when  I  take 
1_gourmet_neg_55	it  out  to  throw  it  away  . 
1_gourmet_neg_56	So  , 
1_gourmet_neg_57	I  believe 
1_gourmet_neg_58	the  reason 
1_gourmet_neg_59	that  there  is  less  actual  coffee  using  Kona  pods  is  that  the  pods  themselves  retain  a  lot  more  water 
1_gourmet_neg_60	and  it  can  not  pass  through  into  the  coffee  cup  . 
1_gourmet_neg_61	Then  , 
1_gourmet_neg_62	as  others  have  mentioned  , 
1_gourmet_neg_63	there  is  the  problem 
1_gourmet_neg_64	that  happens  to  me  about  1\/2  the  time 
1_gourmet_neg_65	when  using  the  Kona  pods  . 
1_gourmet_neg_66	The  problem  is  that  for  whatever  reason  , 
1_gourmet_neg_67	the  water  does  not  actually  go  through 
1_gourmet_neg_68	and  penetrate  the  Kona  pods  during  the  brewing  cycle  . 
1_gourmet_neg_69	The  '  coffee  ' 
1_gourmet_neg_70	that  is  supposed  to  be  coming  out  of  the  spout  is  just  water  ! 
1_gourmet_neg_71	This  problem  is  one  that  I  still  can  not  really  figure  out  . 
1_gourmet_neg_72	The  Kona  pods  are  a  little  smaller  in  diameter  than  all  the  other  pods 
1_gourmet_neg_73	I  have  tried  . 
1_gourmet_neg_74	So  , 
1_gourmet_neg_75	I  guess  that  somehow  the  water  has  enough  room  to  '  go  around  '  the  actual  pod 
1_gourmet_neg_76	and  come  out  of  the  spout  without  '  going  through  '  the  pod 
1_gourmet_neg_77	to  brew  coffee  . 
1_gourmet_neg_78	I  also  wonder  if  the  paper  filter  of  the  Kona  pods  is  different  than  other  pods 
1_gourmet_neg_79	and  for  some  reason  the  Kona  paper  is  more  difficult  for  water 
1_gourmet_neg_80	to  penetrate  . 
1_gourmet_neg_81	I  have  tried 
1_gourmet_neg_82	wetting  the  Kona  pod  paper  filter  right  before  starting  to  brew  the  coffee 
1_gourmet_neg_83	thinking  that  perhaps  it  would  help  the  water 
1_gourmet_neg_84	to  penetrate  the  paper  and  pod  . 
1_gourmet_neg_85	But  ,  that  has  not  worked  for  me  . 
1_gourmet_neg_86	So  , 
1_gourmet_neg_87	it  is  back  to  regular  more  reasonably  priced  coffee  pods  for  me  . 
1_gourmet_neg_88	I  have  wasted  too  many  expensive  Kona  pods  trying  to  get  a  proper  cup  of  coffee  from  them  . 
1_gourmet_neg_89	Even  when  the  Kona  pods  brew  a  cup  of  coffee  , 
1_gourmet_neg_90	it  is  not  as  large  of  an  amount  of  coffee  as  I  get 
1_gourmet_neg_91	using  other  brands  . 
1_gourmet_neg_92	So  , 
1_gourmet_neg_93	adding  the  cost  of  the  Kona  pods  to  the  fact 
1_gourmet_neg_94	that  it  brews  a  smaller  amount  of  coffee  equals  a  product 
1_gourmet_neg_95	that  is  way  too  expensive 
1_gourmet_neg_96	when  it  does  actually  work  . 
1_gourmet_neg_97	I  have  been  reading  of  a  product 
1_gourmet_neg_98	called  an  EcoPod  . 
1_gourmet_neg_99	It  is  a  refillable  pod  for  these  type  of  coffeemakers  . 
1_gourmet_neg_100	It  might  be  the  next  thing 
1_gourmet_neg_101	I  try  .
