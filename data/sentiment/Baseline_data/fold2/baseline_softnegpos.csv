negative	0.125	0.20833333333333331	The  main  issue  with  this  phone  is  its  operating  system  : 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	Windows  Mobile  5.0  .

negative	0.0001	0.0001	----------- 
negative	0.125	0.25	Connectivity  with  T-Mobile  is  horrible  :

negative	0.125	0.25	E-mail  functions  are  useless  . 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  tried

negative	0.0001	0.5	checked  every  hour 
negative	0.125	0.0001	but  deleted  shortly  after  that  . 
negative	0.625	0.25	Internet  explorer  can  NEVER  find  the  page  that  I  'm  looking  for  and  consistently  tells  me  to  try  again  . 
negative	0.0001	0.125	Even  when  connected  to  wi-fi  this  happens  . 
negative	0.625	0.0001	Let  me  tell  you  also  that  this  device  does  not  let  you  choose  between  wi-fi  and  edge  . 
negative	0.125	0.1875	If  you  already  opened  IE  and  you  were  using  EDGE  then  it  will  continue  to  use  EDGE

negative	0.375	0.25	My  calls  should  not  be  dropping  except  for  when  I  'm  in  the  subway  . 
negative	0.125	0.4375	The  side  volume  button  is  extremely  annoying  causing  the  volume

negative	0.625	0.0001	Not  only  that  ,

negative	0.0001	0.1875	you  ca  n't  even  permanently  keep  the  t9  off  . 
negative	0.0001	0.25	So  you  have  to  keep  going  into  the  menu 
negative	0.5	0.0001	to  change  it  to  normal  ABC  mode  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	While  I  appreciate  the  ability  to  have  faster  typing  ,  is  n't  the  whole  point  of  a  QWERTY 
negative	0.125	0.1875	being  able  to  type  without  using  t9  ? 
negative	0.0001	0.25	When  you  actually  get  to  typing  ,  sometimes  ,  the  keys  will    stick  
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  a  character  will  continuously  repeat  until  you  stop  it  .

negative	0.0001	0.5625	at  a  different  direction  from  both  the  grasp 
negative	0.125	0.25	and  the  application  of  the  knife  ,  but  because  the  button  sinks  deep  into  the  handle  ,  so  your  thumb  is  inside  the  handle  as  you  `  re  trying  to  hold  and  control  the  knife  :

negative	0.475	0.25	A  couple  times  I  `  ve  wondered  whether  that  shooting  pain  in  my  thumb  was  from  nerve  torture  or  electric  shock  ;

negative	0.0001	0.25	That  era  has  ended  simply 
negative	0.125	0.1875	because  I  was  beginning  to  get  sick  of  paying  over  $  2.00  for  one  can  . 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  know  several  distributors 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	who  offer  the  product  for  $  1.50  ,

positive	0.625	0.0001	It  never  stopped  me  before

negative	0.5	0.125	However  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	I  recently  noticed  that  on  days 
negative	0.375	0.25	when  I  was  not  in  school  and  I  drank  a  Red  Bull  , 
negative	0.3125	0.375	rather  than  being  full  of  energy 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	and  ready  to  jog  , 
negative	0.0001	0.25	I  would  become  tired  . 
positive	0.0001	0.75	I  began  to  wonder 
positive	0.375	0.125	why  I  would  get  tired  after  drinking  a  can  of  Red  Bull  . 
negative	0.125	0.25	Maybe  my  inner  body  was  saying  , 
negative	0.0001	0.0001	stop  drinking  this  \*\*\*\*  every  freaking  day  of  your  life  !  
positive	0.125	0.25	Whatever  the  case  is  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	I  decided  to  stop  buying  it  on  a  daily  basis 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	and  just  drink  it 
positive	0.25	0.25	when  I  have  to  wake  up  very  early  . 
positive	0.0001	0.5	Hopefully  this  can  make 
positive	0.125	0.25	it  become  effective  on  my  body  again  , 
positive	0.0001	0.0001	because  I  think

positive	0.25	0.375	I  personally  enjoy  drinking  a  cold  can  of  Red  Bull  .
