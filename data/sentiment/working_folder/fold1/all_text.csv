8_cell_neg_1	I  reluctantly  bought  this  phone 
8_cell_neg_2	because  my  Kyocera  Slider  suddenly  died  on  me  conveniently 
8_cell_neg_3	3  months  after  VM  's  warranty  was  up 
8_cell_neg_4	and  i  had  just  purchased  a  $  20  phone 
8_cell_neg_5	card  +  had  airtime  credits 
8_cell_neg_6	which  were  not  refundable  . 
8_cell_neg_7	Now  i  am  not  a  teen 
8_cell_neg_8	and  my  phone  and  things  do  not  receive  harsh  treatment  . 
8_cell_neg_9	My  kyocera  slider  actually  looked  like  new 
8_cell_neg_10	when  it  died  with  no  scratches  what-so-ever  so  i  was  pretty  upset  . 
8_cell_neg_11	After  multiple  calls  and  2  emails  to  VM 
8_cell_neg_12	it  was  pretty  clear  they  were  n't  going  to  do  anything  to  help  . 
8_cell_neg_13	I  was  offered  a  replacement  slider  at  $  20  . 
8_cell_neg_14	Obviously  I  did  n't  want  the  same  one 
8_cell_neg_15	that  could  possibly  die  on  me 
8_cell_neg_16	after  a  couple  of  months  so  like  i  was  saying 
8_cell_neg_17	I  had  no  other  recourse 
8_cell_neg_18	but  to  purchase  this  Audiovox  8610  . 
8_cell_neg_19	By  the  way  AFTER 
8_cell_neg_20	I  PURCHASED  THE  PHONE  AT  A  LOCAL  STORE  IN  TOWN 
8_cell_neg_21	-LRB- 
8_cell_neg_22	when  i  called  to  activate  the  phone  -RRB- 
8_cell_neg_23	they  have  the  nerve 
8_cell_neg_24	to  tell  me  that  I  could  `  ve  purchased  the  same  8610  from  them  at  a  discount  price  of  $  24.99 
8_cell_neg_25	because  the  slider  died  . 
8_cell_neg_26	The  f  !  @  %  ng  idiots  ! 
8_cell_neg_27	HELLO  COULD  YA  NOT  HAVE  TOLD  ME  SOONER  ?  ?  ? 
8_cell_neg_28	and  after  i  spent 
8_cell_neg_29	$  50  +  tax  . 
8_cell_neg_30	sheesh  ! 
8_cell_neg_31	Anyway  back  to  the  phone  review  .  . 
8_cell_neg_32	the  ringer  is  indeed  low 
8_cell_neg_33	as  others  have  reported  here  . 
8_cell_neg_34	Its  so  low  that  if  its  in  my  purse  i  ca  n't  even  hear  it  ! 
8_cell_neg_35	WTF  ?  ?  ? 
8_cell_neg_36	Also  the  battery  life  sucks  ,  no  sooner  does  the  thing  ring  and  the  batteries  at  half  . 
8_cell_neg_37	It  also  doesnt  get  good  service  with  the  VM\/Sprint  network  , 
8_cell_neg_38	my  slider  had  xcellent  service  w\/it 
8_cell_neg_39	despite  everything 
8_cell_neg_40	and  rarely  if  ever  dropped  calls  . 
8_cell_neg_41	So  I  `  ve  had  it  5  days  and  I  'm  considering 
8_cell_neg_42	attempting  to  bring  it  back 
8_cell_neg_43	where  I  purchased  it  from  . 
8_cell_neg_44	However  i  do  n't  want  to  buy  an  expensive  phone  from  VM 
8_cell_neg_45	because  I  'm  seriously  reconsidering  continuing  w\/them  . 
8_cell_neg_46	The  way  I  see 
8_cell_neg_47	it  VM  leaves  alot  to  be  desired  with  the  quality  of  phones 
8_cell_neg_48	they  sell  + 
8_cell_neg_49	they  are  expensive  . 
8_cell_neg_50	I  am  a  lite  user 
8_cell_neg_51	but  if  you  talk  slightly  more  than  usual  you  end  up 
8_cell_neg_52	feeling  it  wallet  -  wise  . 
8_cell_neg_53	Prior  to  these  issues 
8_cell_neg_54	I  was  a  happy  VM  customer  but  not  anymore  . 
9_cell_pos_1	Note  : 
9_cell_pos_2	I  am 
9_cell_pos_3	transitioning  from  using  the  Sony  Ericsson  P910i  smartphone 
9_cell_pos_4	so  my  review  is  based  on  how  well  the  w710i  's  features  work  in  comparison  . 
9_cell_pos_5	I  purchased  this 
9_cell_pos_6	because  I  go  to  remote  areas 
9_cell_pos_7	and  the  P910i  needs  heavy  bandwidth  in  order  for  the  phone  to  function  . 
9_cell_pos_8	My  son  's  Z500  would  work  in  areas 
9_cell_pos_9	my  p910i  would  not  .

9_cell_pos_52	I  am

9_cell_pos_71	if  you  have  answer  on  open  set  -RRB- 
9_cell_pos_72	I  purchased  my  W710i  from  an  internet  company  for  $  254.00 
9_cell_pos_73	and  it  was  shipped  directly  from  Hong  Kong  in  2  business  days  . 
9_cell_pos_74	I  'm  unsure  if  I  can  provide  their  name  here  . 
9_cell_pos_75	Overall  : 
9_cell_pos_76	Sony  has  always  produced  quality  products  . 
9_cell_pos_77	I  love  this  phone 
9_cell_pos_78	and  it  is  a  very  good  comparison  to  a  SmartPhone  . 
9_cell_pos_79	I  do  miss  using  my  styllus  . 
9_cell_pos_80	If  you  do  n't  need  the  bells  and  whistles  of  a  smartphone  ,  go  for  the  Z710i  as  it  is  a  bit  cheaper  but  a  great  contender  . 
9_cell_pos_81	If  I  could  rate  it  more  than  5  stars  , 
9_cell_pos_82	I  would  even  though  I  have  n't  tried  all  of  the  features  of  this  phone  . 
9_cell_pos_83	Buy  it  without  hesitation  ! 
9_cell_pos_84	ADDENDUM  March  5  ,  2007 
9_cell_pos_85	I  dropped  the  phone  on  a  tiled  bathroom  floor  . 
9_cell_pos_86	When  it  hit  ,  the  clip  ,  battery  cover  and  battery 
9_cell_pos_87	scattered  in  different  directions  on  the  floor  . 
9_cell_pos_88	Amazingly  ,  the  phone  still  operates  . 
9_cell_pos_89	The  damage  is  a  barely  noticeable  mark  on  the  upper  left  of  the  phone  . 
9_cell_pos_90	A  mark  like  that 
9_cell_pos_91	could  happen  in  my  purse  ! 
9_cell_pos_92	I  am  really  impressed  now 
9_cell_pos_93	but  hope  I  never  do  that  again  ! 
4_kitchen_pos_1	What  an  awesome  product  ! 
4_kitchen_pos_2	Heavy-duty  and  sturdy  , 
4_kitchen_pos_3	you  'd  never  know 
4_kitchen_pos_4	"it  was  an  ""  assemble-at-home  ""  item  . "
4_kitchen_pos_5	It  's  a  quality  piece  of  furniture  . 
4_kitchen_pos_6	It  's  on  wheels  , 
4_kitchen_pos_7	which  is  a  good  thing 
4_kitchen_pos_8	because  it  is  surprisingly  heavy  . 
4_kitchen_pos_9	Let  's  start  at  the  top  : 
4_kitchen_pos_10	The  butcher  block  top  . 
4_kitchen_pos_11	It  's  three  inches  thick 
4_kitchen_pos_12	and  , 
4_kitchen_pos_13	as  such  , 
4_kitchen_pos_14	it  is  the  heaviest  part  of  the  entire  kitchen  cart  . 
4_kitchen_pos_15	It  is  made  of  fine  ,  high-quality  Asian  hardwoods  . 
4_kitchen_pos_16	The  finish  is  oiled  and  the  manufacturer  recommends  seasoning  it  regularly  with  mineral  oil  . 
4_kitchen_pos_17	The  next  is  the  cart  itself  . 
4_kitchen_pos_18	Immediately  under  the  butcher  block  top  , 
4_kitchen_pos_19	"there  is  a  2  "" "
4_kitchen_pos_20	deep  drawer  . 
4_kitchen_pos_21	It  's  large  and  deep  enough 
4_kitchen_pos_22	to  accommodate  a  standard  utensil  holder  or  other  items  of  your  choice  . 
4_kitchen_pos_23	The  pull  handle  on  the  drawer 
4_kitchen_pos_24	is  fashioned  out  of  brushed  chrome  . 
4_kitchen_pos_25	Beneath  the  drawer  , 
4_kitchen_pos_26	there  is  a  shelf  . 
4_kitchen_pos_27	Surrounding  the  shelf  on  three  sides  are  brushed  chrome  rods  , 
4_kitchen_pos_28	adding  a  modern  look  . 
4_kitchen_pos_29	Matching  the  brushed  chrome  are  three  hooks  on  the  right  side  of  the  cart  ,  perfect  for  hanging  larger  utensils  or  pot  holders  . 
4_kitchen_pos_30	Below  the  shelf  is  a  cabinet  with  two  doors  . 
4_kitchen_pos_31	The  pull  handles  for  the  doors  also  have  a  brushed  chrome  finish  . 
4_kitchen_pos_32	The  cabinet  is  large  enough 
4_kitchen_pos_33	to  hold  an  entire  set  of  dinnerware 
4_kitchen_pos_34	-LRB-  as  in  my  case 
4_kitchen_pos_35	where  I  have  eight  place  settings 
4_kitchen_pos_36	that  include  dinner  and  luncheon  plates  ,  fruit  and  soup  bowls  ,  and  more  -RRB-  . 
4_kitchen_pos_37	Finally  ,  heavy-duty  ,  professional  grade  caster  wheels  support  the  whole  thing  . 
4_kitchen_pos_38	The  two  in  the  front  are  locking  . 
4_kitchen_pos_39	To  prevent  stubbed  toes  ,  the  wheels  can  easily  be  rotated  and  tucked  under  the  unit  . 
4_kitchen_pos_40	The  easy  to  follow  directions  for  assembly 
4_kitchen_pos_41	-LRB- 
4_kitchen_pos_42	which  are  diagrammed  and  in  English  -RRB- 
4_kitchen_pos_43	call 
4_kitchen_pos_44	only  for  a  Philips  screwdriver  . 
4_kitchen_pos_45	A  hex  wrench  is  included  for  the  18  hex  bolts  . 
4_kitchen_pos_46	I  used  an  electric  screwdriver  for  both  the  Philips  screws 
4_kitchen_pos_47	-LRB-  14  in  all  -RRB- 
4_kitchen_pos_48	and  the  hex  bolts 
4_kitchen_pos_49	-LRB- 
4_kitchen_pos_50	after  I  found 
4_kitchen_pos_51	the  right  sized  hex  tip  for  my  screwdriver  -RRB-  . 
4_kitchen_pos_52	I  can  happily  report 
4_kitchen_pos_53	that  all  pieces  fit  together  easily 
4_kitchen_pos_54	-LRB-  no  struggling  to  match  up  this  piece  with  that  piece  -RRB- 
4_kitchen_pos_55	and  all  holes  are  pre-drilled  . 
4_kitchen_pos_56	The  drawer  requires  assembly  also  . 
4_kitchen_pos_57	The  runners  for  the  drawer  are  already  attached  ! 
4_kitchen_pos_58	You  must  put  together  the  front  ,  sides  and  back  of  the  drawer  with  screws 
4_kitchen_pos_59	-LRB-  again  ,  all  holes  are  pre-drilled  -RRB-  . 
4_kitchen_pos_60	A  word  of  advice 
4_kitchen_pos_61	regarding 
4_kitchen_pos_62	assembling  the  drawer  : 
4_kitchen_pos_63	Follow  the  directions 
4_kitchen_pos_64	where  it  says 
4_kitchen_pos_65	to  put  the  screws  in  only  halfway 
4_kitchen_pos_66	before  trying  to  attach  the  bottom  of  the  drawer  . 
4_kitchen_pos_67	I  made  the  mistake  of  tightening  the  screws  too  much  and  had  trouble 
4_kitchen_pos_68	sliding  the  bottom  into  the  assembled  front  ,  back  and  sides  . 
4_kitchen_pos_69	It  's  a  snug  fit  . 
4_kitchen_pos_70	Once  I  loosened  the  screws  enough  ,  the  bottom  easily  popped  into  place 
4_kitchen_pos_71	and  I  was  able  to  sock  it  in  securely  by  tightening  the  screws  . 
4_kitchen_pos_72	I  have  only  one  other  thing 
4_kitchen_pos_73	to  mention  regarding  the  assembly  of  the  entire  cart  : 
4_kitchen_pos_74	Once  the  body  of  the  cart  is  assembled  and  the  unit  is  standing  upright  , 
4_kitchen_pos_75	you 
4_kitchen_pos_76	must  lift  the  butcher  block 
4_kitchen_pos_77	and  set  it  down  on  the  top  of  the  cart  . 
4_kitchen_pos_78	At  this  point  , 
4_kitchen_pos_79	you  have  already  placed  four  cam  lock  screws  on  the  top  of  the  cart 
4_kitchen_pos_80	and  they  `  re  pointing  upward  . 
4_kitchen_pos_81	These  screws  will  fit  into  four  pre-drilled  holes  on  the  bottom  of  the  butcher  block  . 
4_kitchen_pos_82	You  must  align  the  screws  on  the  cart  with  the  holes  on  the  butcher  block  as  you  place  the  butcher  block  on  top  of  the  cart  . 
4_kitchen_pos_83	Because  the  butcher  block  is  so  heavy  , 
4_kitchen_pos_84	you  may  want  to  have  help  . 
4_kitchen_pos_85	But  what  a  reward  it  was  to  see  the  unit  fully  assembled  and  then  to  marvel  at  what  a  quality  piece  of  furniture 
4_kitchen_pos_86	it  ended  up  being  . 
4_kitchen_pos_87	IKEA  sells  a  similar  item  for  twice  the  money  . 
4_kitchen_pos_88	I  give  the  Home  Styles  Double  Door  Kitchen  Cart  with  Butcher  Block  Top  5  stars 
4_kitchen_pos_89	because  of  the  beauty  of  the  product  and  its  better-than-a-bargain  price 
9_kitchen_neg_1	One  might  imagine  that  the  whole  concept  of  vacuuming-flip-mopping  is  progressive  in  some  way  , 
9_kitchen_neg_2	but  it  really  does  not  make  the  job  of  cleaning  the  floor  easier  . 
9_kitchen_neg_3	Especially 
9_kitchen_neg_4	when  the  product  is  heavy  and  hard  to  maneuver  with  poor  pickup  . 
9_kitchen_neg_5	I  'd  much  rather  go  over  the  floor  with  a  good  vacuum  ,  and  then  follow  with  a  functional  ,  well-designed  good  mop 
9_kitchen_neg_6	-LRB-  like  the  old  SteamMop  they 
9_kitchen_neg_7	discontinued  -RRB-  . 
9_kitchen_neg_8	These  things  function  better  as  seperate  units  , 
9_kitchen_neg_9	which  is  why  there  's  no  washing  machine 
9_kitchen_neg_10	that  's  also  a  dryer  . 
9_kitchen_neg_11	The  Flip-It  is  a  very  loud  machine  --  so  loud  , 
9_kitchen_neg_12	that  I  did  n't  hear  my  phone  ring  in  the  same  room  . 
9_kitchen_neg_13	This  makes  it  difficult  to  listen  for  my  3  children  ,  too  . 
9_kitchen_neg_14	It  's  difficult  to  push  and  feels  like  it  's  gripping  to  the  floor  . 
9_kitchen_neg_15	It  does  n't  fit  into  any  tight  places  or  under  any  low  chairs\/cabinets  with  it  's  big  fat  part-vacuum  head  . 
9_kitchen_neg_16	And  , 
9_kitchen_neg_17	when  you  `  re  finished  , 
9_kitchen_neg_18	it  's  a  pain  to  clean  out  the  nozzle  and  the  filter 
9_kitchen_neg_19	-LRB- 
9_kitchen_neg_20	which  you  `  re  supposed  to  keep  dry  somehow  -RRB- 
9_kitchen_neg_21	so  you  can  look  forward  to  a  second  job 
9_kitchen_neg_22	once  you  `  ve  finished  the  job  of  cleaning  your  floors  . 
9_kitchen_neg_23	And  , 
9_kitchen_neg_24	"because  of  the  ""  flip  it  ""  back  and  forth  design  , "
9_kitchen_neg_25	the  thing  has  no  equilibrium  .  .  . 
9_kitchen_neg_26	it  fell  to  the  floor  at  least  3  times  , 
9_kitchen_neg_27	even  when  I  was  so  careful  to  rest  it  against  something  .  .  . 
9_kitchen_neg_28	"once  when  this  happened  ,  the  ""  dirty  water  ""  recovery  tank  hit  the  floor  ,  fell  off  the  machine "
9_kitchen_neg_29	and  spilled  the  dirty  water  all  over  my  just-cleaned  floor  . 
9_kitchen_neg_30	A  true  nightmare  . 
9_kitchen_neg_31	I  bought  this  product 
9_kitchen_neg_32	because  I  could  no  longer  buy  replacement  filters\/pads  for  my  Bissell  SteamMop  ,  and  I  thought 
9_kitchen_neg_33	I  had  better  give  the  latest  and  greatest  a  try  , 
9_kitchen_neg_34	but  ,  sadly  ,  I  was  disappointed  . 
9_kitchen_neg_35	I  do  n't  review  things  often  , 
9_kitchen_neg_36	but  I  felt  a  responsibility  to  warn  others  out  there 
9_kitchen_neg_37	who  are  shopping  for  a  good  mop  to  keep  their  homes  clean  . 
9_kitchen_neg_38	This  contraption  is  not  your  answer  . 
9_kitchen_neg_39	On  a  side  note  , 
9_kitchen_neg_40	I  wrote 
9_kitchen_neg_41	to  Bissell  to  bring  back  the  SteamMop 
9_kitchen_neg_42	-LRB-  what  an  excellent  product  -RRB-  , 
9_kitchen_neg_43	so  I  'm  hoping 
9_kitchen_neg_44	that  they  will  one  day 
19_gourmet_pos_1	Sing  in  me  oh  muse  on  this  snow  day  , 
19_gourmet_pos_2	and  let  me  proclaim  the  many  virtues  of  this  fine  tea  . 
19_gourmet_pos_3	The  scent  and  flavor  of  this  tea  are  as  close  to  my  conception  of  ambrosia  as  anything  else  that  has  yet  crossed  my  palate  . 
19_gourmet_pos_4	It  is  full  without  being  overbearing  , 
19_gourmet_pos_5	it  is  seasoned  without  being  overpowering  . 
19_gourmet_pos_6	It  's  great  with  anything  from  English  breakfast  fare  to  hardy  curry  . 
19_gourmet_pos_7	Since  conception  , 
19_gourmet_pos_8	I  have  been  in  love  with  tea  , 
19_gourmet_pos_9	"but  ""  the  Prince  ""  was  my  first  fine  tea  . "
19_gourmet_pos_10	I  have  still  not  recovered  from  the  episode  in  which  my  father-in-law-to-be  proved  to  me  that  bag  tea  was  a  crime  against  humanity  . 
19_gourmet_pos_11	And  yet  despite  amorous  flirtations  with  rare  white  teas 
19_gourmet_pos_12	and  other  wondrous  Indian  and  Chinese  estate  varieties  with  unpronounceable  names  , 
19_gourmet_pos_13	it  's  still  my  favorite  . 
19_gourmet_pos_14	Never  mind  the  tea  purist  snobs 
19_gourmet_pos_15	who  rank  on  it 
19_gourmet_pos_16	because  it  's  flavored  with  spice  . 
19_gourmet_pos_17	Would  they  send  back  a  fine  filet 
19_gourmet_pos_18	because  the  chef  elected  to  use  some  pepper  or  shallots  ? 
19_gourmet_pos_19	Ignore  the  herbal  tea-totalers 
19_gourmet_pos_20	who  regard  caffeine  as  sinful  . 
19_gourmet_pos_21	They  probably  want  to  outlaw  yoga  on  Sunday  too  . 
19_gourmet_pos_22	Of  the  five  or  so  Kousmichoff  varieties 
19_gourmet_pos_23	I  `  ve  had  ,  this  one  is  the  clear  winner  . 
19_gourmet_pos_24	I  `  ve  gotten  my  best  results  using  HOT  water  steeping  for  five  to  six  minutes  . 
19_gourmet_pos_25	The  stuff  is  potent  enough 
19_gourmet_pos_26	that  you  can  get  , 
19_gourmet_pos_27	gasp  , 
19_gourmet_pos_28	a  reasonably  tannin-free  second  infusion  . 
19_gourmet_pos_29	My  only  reservation  is  this  ; 
19_gourmet_pos_30	once  you  `  ve  entered  the  universe  of  fine  tea  , 
19_gourmet_pos_31	you  can  never  be  satisfied 
19_gourmet_pos_32	drinking  Lipton  ,  Salada  ,  Twinings  or  Tetley  again  . 
19_gourmet_pos_33	In  guise  of  gifts  , 
19_gourmet_pos_34	I  have  managed  to  get  many  of  my  gastronome  friends  and  relations 
19_gourmet_pos_35	addicted  so  that  I  may  sup  of  it 
19_gourmet_pos_36	when  I  visit  . 
19_gourmet_pos_37	Is  n't  it  a  delicious  irony  that  perhaps  the  greatest  bourgeoisie  decadence  of  the  Romanoff  dynasty  is  today 
19_gourmet_pos_38	preserved  by  our  friends  in  socialist  France  ? 
19_gourmet_pos_39	Viva  la  Revolution  ! 
19_gourmet_pos_40	rws  ,  26\/1\/0 
4_gourmet_neg_1	I  read  the  other  reviews 
4_gourmet_neg_2	and  was  greatly  excited  to  order  this  entree  . 
4_gourmet_neg_3	I  have  bought  2-3  varieties  of  Tasty  Bite  from  my  local  Trader  Joes  . 
4_gourmet_neg_4	Most  are  decently  healthy 
4_gourmet_neg_5	and  all  are  easy  and  fast  to  make  . 
4_gourmet_neg_6	Peas  and  paneer  ,  as  an  entree  ,  is  bland  and  without  any  heat\/spice  . 
4_gourmet_neg_7	I  am  a  native  Indian 
4_gourmet_neg_8	so  I  can  handle  relatively  spicy  food  . 
4_gourmet_neg_9	However  , 
4_gourmet_neg_10	this  entree  does  not  merit  even  a  2-chili  rating 
4_gourmet_neg_11	-LRB-  out  of  four  -RRB-  . 
4_gourmet_neg_12	As  for  food  quality  , 
4_gourmet_neg_13	I  would  suggest 
4_gourmet_neg_14	microwaving  the  rice 
4_gourmet_neg_15	and  entree  separately  . 
4_gourmet_neg_16	Otherwise  ,  the  majority  of  the  sauce  seeps  into  the  rice 
4_gourmet_neg_17	giving  it  a  very  unpleasant  appearance  . 
4_gourmet_neg_18	If  you  boil  the  pouches 
4_gourmet_neg_19	-LRB-  an  alternate  option  -RRB-  , 
4_gourmet_neg_20	you  may  have  even  more  success  . 
4_gourmet_neg_21	However  ,  most  of  us  buy  these  because  of  the  ease  of  preparation  , 
4_gourmet_neg_22	so  boiling  is  n't  a  convenient  option  . 
4_gourmet_neg_23	The  rice  tastes 
4_gourmet_neg_24	and  looks  as  it  should  . 
4_gourmet_neg_25	Finally  , 
4_gourmet_neg_26	I  do  recommend  Tasty  Bite  Entr  e  ,  Jaipur  Vegetables  . 
4_gourmet_neg_27	I  am  on  box  nine  of  twelve 
4_gourmet_neg_28	and  still  not  tired  . 
4_gourmet_neg_29	This  entree  is  MUCH  spicier  -  closer 
4_gourmet_neg_30	to  a  3.25  chili  rating 
4_gourmet_neg_31	-LRB-  out  of  four  -RRB-  . 
4_gourmet_neg_32	I  also  favor  this  entree 
4_gourmet_neg_33	because  it  does  n't  have  the  throw-away  plastic  container  in  each  box  . 
4_gourmet_neg_34	Moreover  , 
4_gourmet_neg_35	you  get  12-boxes  for  a  better  price  than  the  6-boxes  for  the  peas  and  paneer  . 
4_gourmet_neg_36	I  look  forward  to  trying  the  other  Tasty  Bites  , 
4_gourmet_neg_37	though  I  will  likely  sample  the  flavors  at  Trader  Joe  's  before  ordering  another  6  -  or  12-box  set  . 
4_gourmet_neg_38	No  more  Tasty  Bite  purchases  from  the  Gold  Box  unless  I  have  already  tried  that  particular  flavor  -  lesson  learned 
19_cell_neg_1	I  had  to  return  this  phone  twice  to  Motorola  for  keys 
19_cell_neg_2	that  were  n't  working  . 
19_cell_neg_3	It  was  too  frustrating  . 
19_cell_neg_4	Ca  n't  use  the  phone  in  my  house  or  at  work  although  my  prior  Nokia  worked  well  . 
19_cell_neg_5	There  are  some  nice  things  -- 
19_cell_neg_6	but  these  are  externals 
19_cell_neg_7	and  certainly  not  explained  in  the  user  manual  . 
19_cell_neg_8	--  customisation  of  the  front  screen  is  do-able  . 
19_cell_neg_9	--  there  's  a  composer  in  the  phone 
19_cell_neg_10	to  compose  your  own  ringtone  . 
19_cell_neg_11	No  mention  in  the  user  manual  . 
19_cell_neg_12	Stumbled  across  it  . 
19_cell_neg_13	--  Ringtones  are  expensive  to  buy  from  Cingular  . 
19_cell_neg_14	First  you  pay  for  the  ringtone 
19_cell_neg_15	and  then 
19_cell_neg_16	you  pay  for  the  access  to  the  internet  to  download  it  . 
19_cell_neg_17	A  double  payment  . 
19_cell_neg_18	The  saving  grace  was  the  ability 
19_cell_neg_19	to  send  the  ringtones  to  myself  by  searching  for  methods  on  the  internet  . 
19_cell_neg_20	--  The  volume  was  always  frustrating  . 
19_cell_neg_21	I  was  unable  to  find  a  ringtone  loud  enough  so 
19_cell_neg_22	that  i  could  hear  the  phone 
19_cell_neg_23	when  it  's  in  my  purse  . 
19_cell_neg_24	Volume  controls  are  easy  . 
19_cell_neg_25	However  putting  the  phone  on  vibrate  was  buried  in  the  menus  and  not  in  the  user  manual  . 
19_cell_neg_26	Counterbalanced  by  the  ability 
19_cell_neg_27	to  put  an  icon  on  the  front  screen  so  i  could  easily  change  it  to  vibrate  . 
19_cell_neg_28	--  I  especially  hate  how  loud  the  phone  is 
19_cell_neg_29	when  you  go  to  turn  it  off  in  a  theater  . 
19_cell_neg_30	You  `  re  being  responsible 
19_cell_neg_31	and  the  phone  does  that  annoying  Moto  noise  . 
19_cell_neg_32	It  's  only  silent 
19_cell_neg_33	when  you  shut  it  down  from  silent  ringing  . 
19_cell_neg_34	Yet  to  set  it  on  silent  ringing  using  the  side  buttons  , 
19_cell_neg_35	you  get  noisy  tones 
19_cell_neg_36	as  you  lower  the  volume 
20_cell_pos_1	Bought  this  to  replace  my  three-year-old  cell  phone  and  an  ancient 
20_cell_pos_2	but  still  working  Palm  IIIc  . 
20_cell_pos_3	My  observations 
20_cell_pos_4	after  30  days  of  ownership  : 
20_cell_pos_5	1  .  Setup  is  time  consuming  but  unavoidable  . 
20_cell_pos_6	Patience  is  required  . 
20_cell_pos_7	I  `  ve  had  a  couple 
20_cell_pos_8	of  questions  that  I  asked  Cingular  ,  only  to  be  forwarded  to  Palm  ,  only  to  be  forwarded  to  Microsoft  , 
20_cell_pos_9	then  back  to  Cingular  . 
20_cell_pos_10	It  seems  no  Customer  Service  department  has  really  mastered  this  unit  . 
20_cell_pos_11	2  .  Have  to  do  a  soft  reset  every  once  in  a  while  . 
20_cell_pos_12	The  unit  turns  off  the  sound  by  itself  and  the  only  way 
20_cell_pos_13	I  `  ve  found  to  fix 
20_cell_pos_14	it  is  to  do  a  soft  reset  . 
20_cell_pos_15	3  .  I  'm  not  crazy  about  Microsoft  Outlook  's  calendar 
20_cell_pos_16	compared  to  Palm  's  . 
20_cell_pos_17	"I  miss  several  Palm  features  ,  like  the  ""  Go  to  ""  and  the  ""  Today  ""  buttons  . "
20_cell_pos_18	Outlook  's  calendar  just  is  n't  as  easy  to  manuever  as  Palm  's  . 
20_cell_pos_19	4  .  Phone  listening  volume  is  low  , 
20_cell_pos_20	especially 
20_cell_pos_21	when  the  unit  is  in  a  protective  case  , 
20_cell_pos_22	which  puts  it  a  little  further  from  your  ear  . 
20_cell_pos_23	5  . 
20_cell_pos_24	Love  the  Bluetooth  option  . 
20_cell_pos_25	It  's  new  to  me 
20_cell_pos_26	and  it  's  just  great  . 
20_cell_pos_27	6  . 
20_cell_pos_28	Love 
20_cell_pos_29	being  able  to  press  a  picture  to  make  a  call  . 
20_cell_pos_30	We  have  five  kids  ; 
20_cell_pos_31	I  have  each  kid  's  picture 
20_cell_pos_32	linked  to  their  phone  number  . 
20_cell_pos_33	Even  my  technology-challenged  husband  can  call  them  by  simply  pressing  their  picture  . 
20_cell_pos_34	7  .  This  phone  talks  ! 
20_cell_pos_35	A  female  voice  announces 
20_cell_pos_36	who  is  calling  and  when  your  next  appointment  is  . 
20_cell_pos_37	The  first  time  she  spoke 
20_cell_pos_38	it  about  scared  me 
20_cell_pos_39	to  death  . 
20_cell_pos_40	The  voice  reminds  me  of  the  computer  on  Star  Trek  -- 
20_cell_pos_41	but  not  as  clear  . 
20_cell_pos_42	However  , 
20_cell_pos_43	after  getting  used  to  her  accent  , 
20_cell_pos_44	she  is  intelligible  , 
20_cell_pos_45	which  means  the  computer  is  translating  my  written  input  into  spoken  words  -- 
20_cell_pos_46	amazing  ! 
20_cell_pos_47	8  . 
20_cell_pos_48	The  Internet  connection  has  limited  use  for  me  . 
20_cell_pos_49	I  do  n't  need  email  on  the  run 
20_cell_pos_50	and  I  could  live  without  this  and  the  extra  monthly  cost  . 
20_cell_pos_51	Most  traditional  Internet  web  sites  take  much  too  long  to  load  and  display  too  small  a  portion  of  the  page  to  be  useful  . 
20_cell_pos_52	It  is  nice  to  check  the  weather  or  get  directions  on  the  go  . 
20_cell_pos_53	9  . 
20_cell_pos_54	Ca  n't  imagine  watching  a  movie  or  any  complex  video  on  this  tiny  screen  . 
20_cell_pos_55	What  's  the  point  ? 
20_cell_pos_56	10  .  Splurged  on  a  sweet  little  Vaja  leather  case 
20_cell_pos_57	that  is  wonderful  . 
20_cell_pos_58	Very  expensive  ,  but  a  terrific  luxury  . 
20_cell_pos_59	11  .  Amazon  's  prices  were  the  best  BY  FAR  on  this  product  ! 
20_cell_pos_60	Saved  over  $  300  off  my  local  retail  Cingular  dealer  . 
20_cell_pos_61	12  . 
20_cell_pos_62	Best  part  : 
20_cell_pos_63	I  no  longer  have  to  carry  a  PDA  and  a  cell  phone  ! 
20_cell_pos_64	They  are  one  and  the  same  ! 
20_cell_pos_65	13  . 
20_cell_pos_66	Conclusion  : 
20_cell_pos_67	this  phone  is  very  smart  and  fun  to  use  , 
20_cell_pos_68	although  it  comes  with  a  big  learning  curve  . 
20_cell_pos_69	The  low  volume 
20_cell_pos_70	issue  could  be  a  problem  for  someone  with  bad  hearing 
9_kitchen_pos_1	Like  many  people  , 
9_kitchen_pos_2	I  have  ignorant  neighbors  that  allow  their  yappy  mutt 
9_kitchen_pos_3	to  bark  on 
9_kitchen_pos_4	and  on  and  on  . 
9_kitchen_pos_5	Despite  talking  to  the  neighbor  politely  and  such  , 
9_kitchen_pos_6	they  still  have  no  concern  for  the  noise  pollution  . 
9_kitchen_pos_7	I  was  losing  sleep  ,  and  the  barking  was  getting  so  bad 
9_kitchen_pos_8	that  I  even  considered  moving  ! 
9_kitchen_pos_9	In  desperation  , 
9_kitchen_pos_10	we  looked  online  for  something  to  stop  barking  dogs  . 
9_kitchen_pos_11	We  came  across  Viatek  's  Super  Bark  Stop 
9_kitchen_pos_12	and  decided  to  risk  the  money  . 
9_kitchen_pos_13	WOW  ,  talk  about  being  worth  the  money  ! 
9_kitchen_pos_14	My  husband  affixed  the  device  on  a  piece  of  wood  , 
9_kitchen_pos_15	and  staked  it  about  5  feet  high  in  our  back  yard  . 
9_kitchen_pos_16	It  's  unsightly  ,  yes  , 
9_kitchen_pos_17	but  we  `  re  the  only  ones 
9_kitchen_pos_18	to  really  see  it  . 
9_kitchen_pos_19	More  importantly  , 
9_kitchen_pos_20	it  's  RIGHT  IN  LINE  WITH  THE  BARKING  MUTT  . 
9_kitchen_pos_21	The  first  time  he  tested  it  , 
9_kitchen_pos_22	he  told  me  the  dog  about  jumped  out  of  its  skin  ! 
9_kitchen_pos_23	We  laughed  gleefully  . 
9_kitchen_pos_24	Could  a  good  night  's  sleep  actually  be  on  the  horizon  .  .  .  ? 
9_kitchen_pos_25	It  's  been  several  days  and  Super  Bark  Stop  has  worked  AMAZINGLY  . 
9_kitchen_pos_26	The  dog  will  lie  as  far  as  it  can  away  from  the  device  .  .  . 
9_kitchen_pos_27	when  it  usually  lay  in  the  middle  of  the  neighbor  's  yard  . 
9_kitchen_pos_28	If  it  starts  to  yelp  a  little  , 
9_kitchen_pos_29	it  stops  almost  immediately  . 
9_kitchen_pos_30	It  's  as  if  it  's  afraid  to  bark  . 
9_kitchen_pos_31	YAY  ! 
9_kitchen_pos_32	You  can  select  the  volume  ,  tone  ,  and  number  of  barks 
9_kitchen_pos_33	to  help  eliminate  false  activation 
9_kitchen_pos_34	-LRB-  say  ,  from  talking  or  loud  bird  squawking  -RRB-  . 
9_kitchen_pos_35	Audible  and  inaudible  both  work  fine  , 
9_kitchen_pos_36	but  we  now  keep  it  on  inaudible  at  the  two  bark  setting  . 
9_kitchen_pos_37	The  device  is  waterproof  plastic 
9_kitchen_pos_38	and  you  need  4  D  batteries 
9_kitchen_pos_39	-LRB-  not  included  -RRB- 
9_kitchen_pos_40	to  operate  it  . 
9_kitchen_pos_41	I  am  SO  thankful 
9_kitchen_pos_42	we  found  Super  Bark  Stop  ! 
9_kitchen_pos_43	My  nerves  were  really  getting  jangled 
9_kitchen_pos_44	and  I  was  dreading  early  mornings  , 
9_kitchen_pos_45	when  they  put  the  mutt  outside  . 
9_kitchen_pos_46	It  's  amazing  at  how  inconsiderate  neighbors  are  ; 
9_kitchen_pos_47	just  because  you  may  want  a  dog  does  n't  mean  I  want  saddled  with  its  noise 
9_kitchen_pos_48	while  you  neglect  it  ! 
9_kitchen_pos_49	P.  S  . 
9_kitchen_pos_50	After  using  Bark  Stop  for  2  weeks  -LRB-  yes  ,  it  did  work  !  -RRB-  , 
9_kitchen_pos_51	we  noticed  that  the  neighbors  dog  started  to  bark  a  bit  more  . 
9_kitchen_pos_52	-LRB-  Not  as  bad  as  before  ,  though  .  -RRB- 
9_kitchen_pos_53	We  had  it  on  silent  , 
9_kitchen_pos_54	and  realized 
9_kitchen_pos_55	that  it  had  stopped  working  . 
9_kitchen_pos_56	Apparently  , 
9_kitchen_pos_57	it  's  not  100  %  waterproof  , 
9_kitchen_pos_58	despite  the  claims  of  the  manufacturer  . 
9_kitchen_pos_59	The  person 
9_kitchen_pos_60	I  bought  it  from  said 
9_kitchen_pos_61	"that  ""  once  it  's  opened  ,  we  find  that  it  's  not  100  %  waterproof  ""  . "
9_kitchen_pos_62	Well  guess 
9_kitchen_pos_63	what  ? 
9_kitchen_pos_64	You  gotta  open  it  to  put  the  batteries  in  it  ! 
9_kitchen_pos_65	Either  buy  a  faux  bird  house 
9_kitchen_pos_66	to  protect  Bark  Stop  or  house  it 
9_kitchen_pos_67	where  it  wo  n't  get  wet  . 
9_kitchen_pos_68	Otherwise  ,  you  may  find  yourself  in  the  same  position 
9_kitchen_pos_69	we  were  in  . 
9_kitchen_pos_70	We  got  a  refund  ,  and  fortunately  for  us  , 
9_kitchen_pos_71	our  neighbors  got  rid  of  their  dog  .  .  .  so  we  did  n't  bother  getting  a  new  one 
8_kitchen_neg_1	One  might  imagine  that  the  whole  concept  of  vacuuming-flip-mopping  is  progressive  in  some  way  , 
8_kitchen_neg_2	but  it  really  does  not  make  the  job  of  cleaning  the  floor  easier  . 
8_kitchen_neg_3	Especially 
8_kitchen_neg_4	when  the  product  is  heavy  and  hard  to  maneuver  with  poor  pickup  . 
8_kitchen_neg_5	I  'd  much  rather  go  over  the  floor  with  a  good  vacuum  ,  and  then  follow  with  a  functional  ,  well-designed  good  mop 
8_kitchen_neg_6	-LRB-  like  the  old  SteamMop  they 
8_kitchen_neg_7	discontinued  -RRB-  . 
8_kitchen_neg_8	These  things  function  better  as  seperate  units  , 
8_kitchen_neg_9	which  is  why  there  's  no  washing  machine 
8_kitchen_neg_10	that  's  also  a  dryer  . 
8_kitchen_neg_11	The  Flip-It  is  a  very  loud  machine  --  so  loud  , 
8_kitchen_neg_12	that  I  did  n't  hear  my  phone  ring  in  the  same  room  . 
8_kitchen_neg_13	This  makes  it  difficult  to  listen  for  my  3  children  ,  too  . 
8_kitchen_neg_14	It  's  difficult  to  push  and  feels  like  it  's  gripping  to  the  floor  . 
8_kitchen_neg_15	It  does  n't  fit  into  any  tight  places  or  under  any  low  chairs\/cabinets  with  it  's  big  fat  part-vacuum  head  . 
8_kitchen_neg_16	And  , 
8_kitchen_neg_17	when  you  `  re  finished  , 
8_kitchen_neg_18	it  's  a  pain  to  clean  out  the  nozzle  and  the  filter 
8_kitchen_neg_19	-LRB- 
8_kitchen_neg_20	which  you  `  re  supposed  to  keep  dry  somehow  -RRB- 
8_kitchen_neg_21	so  you  can  look  forward  to  a  second  job 
8_kitchen_neg_22	once  you  `  ve  finished  the  job  of  cleaning  your  floors  . 
8_kitchen_neg_23	And  , 
8_kitchen_neg_24	"because  of  the  ""  flip  it  ""  back  and  forth  design  , "
8_kitchen_neg_25	the  thing  has  no  equilibrium  .  .  . 
8_kitchen_neg_26	it  fell  to  the  floor  at  least  3  times  , 
8_kitchen_neg_27	even  when  I  was  so  careful  to  rest  it  against  something  .  .  . 
8_kitchen_neg_28	"once  when  this  happened  ,  the  ""  dirty  water  ""  recovery  tank  hit  the  floor  ,  fell  off  the  machine "
8_kitchen_neg_29	and  spilled  the  dirty  water  all  over  my  just-cleaned  floor  . 
8_kitchen_neg_30	A  true  nightmare  . 
8_kitchen_neg_31	I  bought  this  product 
8_kitchen_neg_32	because  I  could  no  longer  buy  replacement  filters\/pads  for  my  Bissell  SteamMop  ,  and  I  thought 
8_kitchen_neg_33	I  had  better  give  the  latest  and  greatest  a  try  , 
8_kitchen_neg_34	but  ,  sadly  ,  I  was  disappointed  . 
8_kitchen_neg_35	I  do  n't  review  things  often  , 
8_kitchen_neg_36	but  I  felt  a  responsibility  to  warn  others  out  there 
8_kitchen_neg_37	who  are  shopping  for  a  good  mop  to  keep  their  homes  clean  . 
8_kitchen_neg_38	This  contraption  is  not  your  answer  . 
8_kitchen_neg_39	On  a  side  note  , 
8_kitchen_neg_40	I  wrote 
8_kitchen_neg_41	to  Bissell  to  bring  back  the  SteamMop 
8_kitchen_neg_42	-LRB-  what  an  excellent  product  -RRB-  , 
8_kitchen_neg_43	so  I  'm  hoping 
8_kitchen_neg_44	that  they  will  one  day 
11_gourmet_pos_1	I  bought  a  few  bags  of  these  noodles 
11_gourmet_pos_2	after  reading  a  very  favorable  review  of  them  on  the  Hungry  Girl  website  , 
11_gourmet_pos_3	and  I  am  glad 
11_gourmet_pos_4	that  I  did  . 
11_gourmet_pos_5	They  work  well  in  a  number  of  different  recipes  ,  are  filling  , 
11_gourmet_pos_6	"and  add  a  ""  calcium  boost  ""  to  the  dishes "
11_gourmet_pos_7	I  use  them  in  ,  for  very  few  calories  . 
11_gourmet_pos_8	"These  are  not  ""  pasta  ""  type  noodles  ,  of  course  - "
11_gourmet_pos_9	the  texture  is  different 
11_gourmet_pos_10	"-LRB-  softer  and  kind  of  ""  slippery  ""  -RRB-  , "
11_gourmet_pos_11	and  they  have  virtually  no  flavor  of  their  own  - 
11_gourmet_pos_12	they  take  on  the  flavor 
11_gourmet_pos_13	of  whatever  sauce  or  dressing  you 
11_gourmet_pos_14	use  with  them  . 
11_gourmet_pos_15	I  probably  wo  n't  use  these  noodles  with  European-style  or  American-style  sauces  such  as  marinara  or  cheese  sauce  -  those  types  of  sauces  were  created  for  grain-based  pastas  , 
11_gourmet_pos_16	which  these  are  not  . 
11_gourmet_pos_17	On  the  other  hand  ,  these  noodles  are  fine  in  such  Asian  recipes  as  Pad  Thai  ,  Lo  Mein  and  Dan-Dan  Noodes 
11_gourmet_pos_18	-LRB-  basically  ,  noodles  in  a  spicy  peanut  or  sesame  sauce  -RRB-  . 
11_gourmet_pos_19	There  are  a  lot  of  Asian-style  recipes  in  cookbooks  and  on  the  Internet 
11_gourmet_pos_20	which  are  fairly  easy  to  make  ,  taste  terrific  , 
11_gourmet_pos_21	and  work  beautifully  with  these  noodles  . 
11_gourmet_pos_22	You  can  prepare  yourself  a  real  treat  , 
11_gourmet_pos_23	if  you  use  these  noodles  in  the  types  of  recipes 
11_gourmet_pos_24	that  work  well  with  their  texture  , 
11_gourmet_pos_25	and  for  a  fraction  of  the  calories 
11_gourmet_pos_26	you  'd  eat  if  using  regular  noodles  or  rice  . 
11_gourmet_pos_27	In  short  , 
11_gourmet_pos_28	if  you  attempt  something  like  spaghetti  with  meatballs  or  chicken  cacciatore 
11_gourmet_pos_29	using  these  noodles  , 
11_gourmet_pos_30	you  `  re  likely  to  be  disappointed  , 
11_gourmet_pos_31	but  if  you  use  them  in  Pad  Thai  ,  any  type  of  curry  ,  other  Asian  dishes  ,  or  most  soups  , 
11_gourmet_pos_32	you  `  re  likely  to  find  yourself  enjoying  a  delicious  and  wonderfully  low-cal  ,  low-carb  meal  . 
11_gourmet_pos_33	One  thing 
11_gourmet_pos_34	- 
11_gourmet_pos_35	when  you  open  the  bag  , 
11_gourmet_pos_36	there  is  a  slight  ammonia-like  odor 
11_gourmet_pos_37	-LRB-  it  smells  ammonia-like  to  me  ,  anyway  -RRB-  . 
11_gourmet_pos_38	If  you  rinse  the  noodles  well 
11_gourmet_pos_39	and  then  parboil  them  for  a  few  minutes  ,  as  per  the  package  directions  , 
11_gourmet_pos_40	the  odor  really  does  disappear  . 
11_gourmet_pos_41	It  is  not  a  strong  odor  , 
11_gourmet_pos_42	it  wo  n't  permeate  your  kitchen  or  anything  like  that  , 
11_gourmet_pos_43	but  you  will  definitely  want  to  rinse  and  parboil  the  noodles  before  using  them  . 
11_gourmet_pos_44	Just  follow  the  package  directions 
18_gourmet_neg_1	I  have  an  Indian 
18_gourmet_neg_2	-LRB-  American  -RRB- 
18_gourmet_neg_3	friend  , 
18_gourmet_neg_4	that  gets  free  whole  powdered  eggs  from  the  gov  commodity  program  . 
18_gourmet_neg_5	"She  has  often  made  me  ""  yummy\/flavorfull  ""  egg  sandwiches "
18_gourmet_neg_6	-LRB-  i.  e  .  scrambled  eggs  .  .  .  -RRB-  ! 
18_gourmet_neg_7	I  decided  to  buy  some  Honeyville  &  try  it  ? 
18_gourmet_neg_8	What  a  disappointment  for  scrambled  eggs 
18_gourmet_neg_9	-LRB-  do  n't  know  about  baking  .  .  .  ?  -RRB-  ! 
18_gourmet_neg_10	1  .  Their  is  NO  flavor  , 
18_gourmet_neg_11	whatsoever  !  !  ! 
18_gourmet_neg_12	2  . 
18_gourmet_neg_13	"Sticks  ""  hard  ""  to  oiled  stainless  frying  pan "
18_gourmet_neg_14	-LRB-  fried  like  a  pancake  -RRB- 
18_gourmet_neg_15	- 
18_gourmet_neg_16	Worked  better 
18_gourmet_neg_17	when  I  mixed  in  1tsp  of  Canola  oil  ,  per  egg  .  .  . 
18_gourmet_neg_18	-LRB-  like  waffles  .  .  .  -RRB-  . 
18_gourmet_neg_19	For  1  egg  sandwich  - 
18_gourmet_neg_20	I  mix  1\/4  cup  water  ,  to  1\/4  cup  mix 
18_gourmet_neg_21	-LRB-  they  say  2-1  -RRB-  , 
18_gourmet_neg_22	which  was  a  runny  mess 
18_gourmet_neg_23	-LRB-  maybe  for  baking  ?  -RRB-  . 
18_gourmet_neg_24	Limited  shelf  life  .  .  . 
18_gourmet_neg_25	- 
18_gourmet_neg_26	I  store  unused  mix  in  the  freezer
