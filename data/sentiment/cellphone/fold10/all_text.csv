10_cell_pos_1	I ` ve had this phone for about a week now and I 'm glad
10_cell_pos_2	I waited to post a review
10_cell_pos_3	because my initial reaction was not very positive .
10_cell_pos_4	Coming from owning a RAZR and many Windows-based devices ,
10_cell_pos_5	there was an initial learning curve to some of the functions .
10_cell_pos_6	Also , I was NOT convinced that the strange keyboard would really recognize what you were attempting to type .
10_cell_pos_7	Boy was I wrong about that one .
10_cell_pos_8	OK , so for the review .
10_cell_pos_9	My motivation for purchasing was primarily to get a PHONE first , with a few bells and whistles for when I just want to play with the device .
10_cell_pos_10	The Pearl fits that bill perfectly .
10_cell_pos_11	Phone quality is excellent .
10_cell_pos_12	Loading ringtones
10_cell_pos_13	-LRB- a pain at first -RRB-
10_cell_pos_14	proved
10_cell_pos_15	to be relatively easy
10_cell_pos_16	once I did a little research .
10_cell_pos_17	Ringtones play very loud and clear .
10_cell_pos_18	The music player is MUCH better
10_cell_pos_19	than first impressions would lead you
10_cell_pos_20	to believe .
10_cell_pos_21	After a few hours of frustration ,
10_cell_pos_22	I was all ready to purchase a 3rd party app .
10_cell_pos_23	Again , did some research ,
10_cell_pos_24	visited a few forums ,
10_cell_pos_25	and found out
10_cell_pos_26	there is much more functionality in the included music player than you might realize .
10_cell_pos_27	As an owner of a NANO ,
10_cell_pos_28	I was disappointed with the interface of the player .
10_cell_pos_29	But once you go into the menu functions ,
10_cell_pos_30	you ` ll find much more functionality .
10_cell_pos_31	It 's not an ipod ,
10_cell_pos_32	but it works as an decent replacement .
10_cell_pos_33	And if you ` re not an ipod owner ,
10_cell_pos_34	you ` ll likely have no complaints .
10_cell_pos_35	Sound of tunes is quite nice
10_cell_pos_36	when using headphones .
10_cell_pos_37	Camera is only so-so ,
10_cell_pos_38	but I do n't really care about that
10_cell_pos_39	anyway .
10_cell_pos_40	Must admit that I thought
10_cell_pos_41	it would be better
10_cell_pos_42	since it is a megapixal camera .
10_cell_pos_43	The couple of pictures
10_cell_pos_44	I took were dark and somewhat grainy .
10_cell_pos_45	Part of why I dropped my rating from 5 stars .
10_cell_pos_46	As far as email ,
10_cell_pos_47	I have a BB from work
10_cell_pos_48	and they wo n't let me use a non-work issued device to access the network , so I have no opinion on email functionality .
10_cell_pos_49	Organizer features
10_cell_pos_50	-LRB- calendar , tasks , notes ,
10_cell_pos_51	etc -RRB- seem more than adequate .
10_cell_pos_52	Much better than any of my old Pocket PC devices .
10_cell_pos_53	The only complaints I would have is that there are still 2 basic things
10_cell_pos_54	that I have n't been able to figure out
10_cell_pos_55	and while I 'm admittingly not a techie ,
10_cell_pos_56	these should be pretty basic and intuitive .
10_cell_pos_57	One ,
10_cell_pos_58	I would like to set one of my ringtones as the default ringer .
10_cell_pos_59	That should be fairly simplistic
10_cell_pos_60	but I ca n't figure it out .
10_cell_pos_61	Two ,
10_cell_pos_62	I would like to change the order of the icons on some of the themes .
10_cell_pos_63	Again , should be pretty basic ,
10_cell_pos_64	but no go .
10_cell_pos_65	Almost forgot , ca n't listen to music through bluetooth .
10_cell_pos_66	Not sure why ,
10_cell_pos_67	but this is really my only MAJOR complaint .
10_cell_pos_68	Only minor complaints .
10_cell_pos_69	All in all , a pretty sweet device .
10_cell_pos_70	And BTW , form factor and looks are simply the best out there .
10_cell_pos_71	I came so close to purchasing the Blackjack , very happy
10_cell_pos_72	that I went with the Pearl .
10_cell_pos_73	UPDATE -
10_cell_pos_74	Figured out
10_cell_pos_75	how to set default ringtone and move icons .
10_cell_pos_76	Coming from a Windows mobile environment ,
10_cell_pos_77	I was expecting something along the lines of :
10_cell_pos_78	Start-programs-etc-etc .
10_cell_pos_79	Everyting in windows takes so many keystroks .
10_cell_pos_80	With the Pearl ,
10_cell_pos_81	it was so easy .
10_cell_pos_82	I was simply expecting it to be much more difficult based on my prior experience .
10_cell_pos_83	I 'm going to still keep it at 4 stars
10_cell_pos_84	because of the lack of BT stereo .
10_cell_pos_85	Otherwise ,
10_cell_pos_86	as close to a perfect device as I ` ve used
10_cell_pos_87	-LRB- and I ` ve used quite a few -RRB-
