17_kitchen_pos_1	Ok let
17_kitchen_pos_2	me start by saying
17_kitchen_pos_3	I am not a coffee snob ,
17_kitchen_pos_4	I am more of a coffee nut ,
17_kitchen_pos_5	I very much prefer a cup of my nice dark italian roast
17_kitchen_pos_6	but if the neighbor offers me a cup of his foldgers
17_kitchen_pos_7	I wont turn up my nose .
17_kitchen_pos_8	And for a guy like me this machine is perfect ! !
17_kitchen_pos_9	I looked at the 500 dollar machines
17_kitchen_pos_10	but just couldnt see
17_kitchen_pos_11	spending
17_kitchen_pos_12	that for something I see myself using 4-5 days out of the week so I setteled on this machine
17_kitchen_pos_13	and I have not one regret .
17_kitchen_pos_14	I have had the machine about 3 weeks now ,
17_kitchen_pos_15	I admit I dont use it every day as I have thoses mornings
17_kitchen_pos_16	where I am just running late
17_kitchen_pos_17	and dont have time ,
17_kitchen_pos_18	but in that three weeks I have used it at least 5 days out of every week
17_kitchen_pos_19	and it has been great .
17_kitchen_pos_20	This thing is so easy to use right out of the box with the pods I was just amased ,
17_kitchen_pos_21	my old machine went down quite
17_kitchen_pos_22	a while ago so I havent pulled a shot in a very long time and with this machine
17_kitchen_pos_23	I was sipping a great one in minutes !
17_kitchen_pos_24	The one thing
17_kitchen_pos_25	that did dissapoint
17_kitchen_pos_26	me is the pods ,
17_kitchen_pos_27	I bought the machine
17_kitchen_pos_28	thinking I would use them
17_kitchen_pos_29	as they seemed so convient . . .
17_kitchen_pos_30	and dont get
17_kitchen_pos_31	me wrong ,
17_kitchen_pos_32	the illy dark roast pods make one of the best shots of espresso
17_kitchen_pos_33	I have ever had , very quickly ,
17_kitchen_pos_34	but keep in mind
17_kitchen_pos_35	they only make one shot at a time so for me
17_kitchen_pos_36	who usually likes 3 or 4 shots in a cappucino
17_kitchen_pos_37	they are a bit time consuming
17_kitchen_pos_38	and I have found it better
17_kitchen_pos_39	to just pack my own double shots .
17_kitchen_pos_40	But besides that little thing
17_kitchen_pos_41	this machine is perfect for a coffee nut like me ,
17_kitchen_pos_42	it does a great job no matter
17_kitchen_pos_43	what im in the mood for , be it a straight shot , a cappucino , or the nice mocha latte every now
17_kitchen_pos_44	and then this is a great machine for you ,
17_kitchen_pos_45	may not be good enough for a coffee snob . . .
17_kitchen_pos_46	but just right for a coffee nut !
17_kitchen_pos_47	Oh and one hint I found very helpfull . . .
17_kitchen_pos_48	turn the machine on 5 or 10 minutes
17_kitchen_pos_49	before you are going to use it -LRB- the longer the better -RRB-
17_kitchen_pos_50	with your cups up on the warmer .
17_kitchen_pos_51	I saw some people complaining that the espresso was only luke warm
17_kitchen_pos_52	when it came out ,
17_kitchen_pos_53	I exprenced the same problem
17_kitchen_pos_54	when I dont let it warm up
17_kitchen_pos_55	and brew into a cold cup , but if you do let it warm up it will make
17_kitchen_pos_56	you a nice
17_kitchen_pos_57	piping hot espresso !
