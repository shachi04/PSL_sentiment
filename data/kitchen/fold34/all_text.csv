14_kitchen_neg_1	If I could give this product 0 stars ,
14_kitchen_neg_2	I would .
14_kitchen_neg_3	READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS , FOLKS ,
14_kitchen_neg_4	AND BE FOREWARNED .
14_kitchen_neg_5	I believed the positive reviews
14_kitchen_neg_6	and ignored the negative ones , much to my exasperation .
14_kitchen_neg_7	When I plugged my handsome new oven in , the little red digital display numbers came on right away . . .
14_kitchen_neg_8	hmmm . . .
14_kitchen_neg_9	so far so good .
14_kitchen_neg_10	But ,
14_kitchen_neg_11	according to the instructions ,
14_kitchen_neg_12	you are supposed to run the oven with the door open for 15 minutes to get rid of the new oven smell .
14_kitchen_neg_13	Sooo . . .
14_kitchen_neg_14	the owner 's manual says
14_kitchen_neg_15	"to push the "" bake "" button on the dashboard ,"
14_kitchen_neg_16	which in turn lights the pilot LID light on the display ,
14_kitchen_neg_17	"after which you can set "" time """
14_kitchen_neg_18	"and "" temp "" ."
14_kitchen_neg_19	"So I push the "" bake "" button and nothing happens ,"
14_kitchen_neg_20	no LID light comes on .
14_kitchen_neg_21	Nothing .
14_kitchen_neg_22	Zilch .
14_kitchen_neg_23	Zippo .
14_kitchen_neg_24	"So I then push the "" temp """
14_kitchen_neg_25	"and "" time "" lights to try to get the gerbils to wake up ."
14_kitchen_neg_26	Still nothing .
14_kitchen_neg_27	I unplugged
14_kitchen_neg_28	it and and plugged it in again ,
14_kitchen_neg_29	thinking
14_kitchen_neg_30	that maybe somehow I had screwed that
14_kitchen_neg_31	up ,
14_kitchen_neg_32	"while listening for the "" beep "" the owner 's manual said"
14_kitchen_neg_33	should happen whence the unit is plugged in .
14_kitchen_neg_34	Zilch .
14_kitchen_neg_35	Zippo .
14_kitchen_neg_36	Nothing .
14_kitchen_neg_37	"No "" beep "" ."
14_kitchen_neg_38	"No "" bake "" LID light ."
14_kitchen_neg_39	"Tried pusing the "" temp """
14_kitchen_neg_40	"and "" time "" buttons again ."
14_kitchen_neg_41	Nada .
14_kitchen_neg_42	Tried unpugging it again
14_kitchen_neg_43	and doing the whole shebang all over again .
14_kitchen_neg_44	Still nothing .
14_kitchen_neg_45	It just sat there
14_kitchen_neg_46	and grinned at me .
14_kitchen_neg_47	About this time ,
14_kitchen_neg_48	I figured out
14_kitchen_neg_49	"that my unit was also "" dead on arrival "" ."
14_kitchen_neg_50	At least you can get a parcel
14_kitchen_neg_51	paid bill
14_kitchen_neg_52	of lading
14_kitchen_neg_53	printed off from the Amazon website for a defective product return ,
14_kitchen_neg_54	saving yourself the annoyance of prepaying to return a dead product
14_kitchen_neg_55	you have already paid for and now must wait weeks
14_kitchen_neg_56	to get a refund on .
14_kitchen_neg_57	Amazon should take the remainder of their stock of this awful product out to the back lot of their warehouse
14_kitchen_neg_58	and run them over with a forklift
