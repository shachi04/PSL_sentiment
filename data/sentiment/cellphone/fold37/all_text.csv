17_cell_neg_1	I would n't buy this
17_cell_neg_2	unless it 's an emergency ,
17_cell_neg_3	because it 's one of those chargers
17_cell_neg_4	that reports errors ,
17_cell_neg_5	and makes your phone start beeping non-stop
17_cell_neg_6	when it 's done charging .
17_cell_neg_7	I do n't want this
17_cell_neg_8	because I like charging at night , the other chargers do n't do this
17_cell_neg_9	-LRB- I guess what it does is it starts fluctuating power from the wall , like switching off ,
17_cell_neg_10	when the battery is fully charged . .
17_cell_neg_11	so it beeps as if it 's being plugged in over
17_cell_neg_12	and over -RRB- .
17_cell_neg_13	When I first got it ,
17_cell_neg_14	I was trying to carefully plug it into my phone -- and I did n't want to damage the little metal things inside my phone OR on the charger .
17_cell_neg_15	It was n't going in smoothly
17_cell_neg_16	and it did n't match up
17_cell_neg_17	or seem to fit inside at ALL .
17_cell_neg_18	So I went a day without a phone
17_cell_neg_19	and I did more research to see
17_cell_neg_20	why the heck they 'd lie that it fit my phone .
17_cell_neg_21	Finally I got
17_cell_neg_22	fed up
17_cell_neg_23	because I could n't find another charger ANYWHERE
17_cell_neg_24	where I live
17_cell_neg_25	and I tried
17_cell_neg_26	forcing it .
17_cell_neg_27	FINALLY
17_cell_neg_28	it fit !
17_cell_neg_29	But I had to shove it in . .
17_cell_neg_30	who knows if it was damaging my phone .
17_cell_neg_31	But it was charging
17_cell_neg_32	so I was happy
17_cell_neg_33	-LRB- my cell is my only phone . .
17_cell_neg_34	so I was cut off from the world -RRB- .
17_cell_neg_35	Then I tried getting it out
17_cell_neg_36	and could n't figure it out !
17_cell_neg_37	I had to jimmy it off ,
17_cell_neg_38	and broke off one of the side hooks
17_cell_neg_39	that helps it secure itself .
17_cell_neg_40	I was able to put it back on , and finally learned a routine so to speak , for taking it off ,
17_cell_neg_41	but it 's cheap .
17_cell_neg_42	It 's very cheap .
17_cell_neg_43	So , the charger works ,
17_cell_neg_44	but it 's very hard to use and it is n't convenient at all .
17_cell_neg_45	I do n't recommend it
17_cell_neg_46	unless it 's an emergency .
17_cell_neg_47	For me ,
17_cell_neg_48	it was
