13_cell_neg_1	After owning 3 Blackberry 's over the years ,
13_cell_neg_2	I made the switch to the BlackJack because of the camera and the ability to add memory .
13_cell_neg_3	Compared to the Blackberry , the Microsoft operating system is very cumbersome
13_cell_neg_4	-LRB- for me -RRB-
13_cell_neg_5	and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially .
13_cell_neg_6	On the plus side ,
13_cell_neg_7	the Blackjack has good battery life ,
13_cell_neg_8	the screen is excellent
13_cell_neg_9	and it has the best reception
13_cell_neg_10	I ` ve ever experienced .
13_cell_neg_11	The reason I only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink
13_cell_neg_12	-LRB- ie :
13_cell_neg_13	the numbers -RRB-
13_cell_neg_14	began
13_cell_neg_15	wearing off the keys .
13_cell_neg_16	It 's to the point now where the phone is pretty much unusable ,
13_cell_neg_17	especially
13_cell_neg_18	when it 's backlit .
13_cell_neg_19	I called Cingular first ,
13_cell_neg_20	who passed me on the Samsung
13_cell_neg_21	where , after 2 hours on the phone ,
13_cell_neg_22	I was told
13_cell_neg_23	that my only option was to send the phone -LRB- my primary source of communication -RRB-
13_cell_neg_24	to their service center
13_cell_neg_25	and wait 3 weeks .
13_cell_neg_26	To my surprise ,
13_cell_neg_27	they went on to say
13_cell_neg_28	that , at their discretion ,
13_cell_neg_29	they might also charge me for the repair .
13_cell_neg_30	I ` ve read comments on these reviews were people
13_cell_neg_31	complained about service
13_cell_neg_32	and I always just assumed
13_cell_neg_33	they were exaggerating
13_cell_neg_34	but now that I ` ve encountered this ,
13_cell_neg_35	I do feel
13_cell_neg_36	it 's worth
13_cell_neg_37	considering .
13_cell_neg_38	If you ` re thinking about a Blackjack ,
13_cell_neg_39	I encourage you to be aware
13_cell_neg_40	that , for one , the ink may inexplicably wear off the keys ,
13_cell_neg_41	and ,
13_cell_neg_42	that you may well be on your own
13_cell_neg_43	when it comes to service .
13_cell_neg_44	I feel that it 's reasonable to expect a device as expensive
13_cell_neg_45	as this to remain functional for at least 3 months and if not , the company who sold it should assume responsibility for making it right .
