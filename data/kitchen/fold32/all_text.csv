12_kitchen_neg_1	I ` ve bought a number of Oxo kitchen accessories , and found them to be sturdy , remarkably well designed ,
12_kitchen_neg_2	and easy to use .
12_kitchen_neg_3	Unfortunately , this timer is an exception .
12_kitchen_neg_4	It has the usual features typical of timers at this price point :
12_kitchen_neg_5	clock plus timer , ten number keys for input , memory , etc .
12_kitchen_neg_6	But instead of being flat with a magnet on the back
12_kitchen_neg_7	so it can fall off the refrigerator like other timers ,
12_kitchen_neg_8	it 's round like a traditional wind-up kitchen timer .
12_kitchen_neg_9	It 's solid-feeling
12_kitchen_neg_10	and has nice non-skid feet on the bottom .
12_kitchen_neg_11	The problem is the display .
12_kitchen_neg_12	It 's horrible .
12_kitchen_neg_13	For three reasons :
12_kitchen_neg_14	First , the numbers are small -- smaller than any other timer
12_kitchen_neg_15	I ` ve seen .
12_kitchen_neg_16	"They ` re about 1\/4 "" high ,"
12_kitchen_neg_17	half or less the size of those on comparable timers .
12_kitchen_neg_18	"Second , the numbers are recessed 1\/8 "" or more beneath a clear plastic cover , not on the surface"
12_kitchen_neg_19	-- it 's dark in there and feels like looking down a well .
12_kitchen_neg_20	It desperately needs a backlight ,
12_kitchen_neg_21	but there is none .
12_kitchen_neg_22	Unless the light source is shining directly into the display ,
12_kitchen_neg_23	there 's a large dark shadow
12_kitchen_neg_24	covering part of the numbers .
12_kitchen_neg_25	But that causes the third problem :
12_kitchen_neg_26	The clear plastic cover over the numbers is both curved and highly reflective ,
12_kitchen_neg_27	and it 's virtually impossible to arrange things so that there is n't a reflection
12_kitchen_neg_28	shining back into your eyes .
12_kitchen_neg_29	The bottom line is that I have to fiddle around to get the timer , the light source , and myself into a position
12_kitchen_neg_30	where I can read the small , dark , shadowed ,
12_kitchen_neg_31	and reflective display .
12_kitchen_neg_32	Not what I need
12_kitchen_neg_33	when I 'm trying to cook .
12_kitchen_neg_34	It 's just not worth it .
12_kitchen_neg_35	Since I have several other timers with displays
12_kitchen_neg_36	I do n't have to strain to read ,
12_kitchen_neg_37	I use this one as a paperweight .
12_kitchen_neg_38	I 'd have to say
12_kitchen_neg_39	it works very well .
12_kitchen_neg_40	I just do n't understand
12_kitchen_neg_41	how Oxo managed to let such a flawed design out the door
