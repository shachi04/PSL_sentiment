8_gourmet_neg_1	We were happy with the gift baskets
8_gourmet_neg_2	that were delivered .
8_gourmet_neg_3	However the company only has one distribution center in California ,
8_gourmet_neg_4	which is obviously not efficient to deliver to the East Coast .
8_gourmet_neg_5	Despite the company 's ambitions
8_gourmet_neg_6	to become a national company ,
8_gourmet_neg_7	they are not willing to pony up the money to get additional distribution facilities outside of California .
8_gourmet_neg_8	This maybe great if you live in California .
8_gourmet_neg_9	However I live in Florida
8_gourmet_neg_10	and I ordered on December 22
8_gourmet_neg_11	and my basket did not arrive until January 4th .
8_gourmet_neg_12	I think
8_gourmet_neg_13	that would be unacceptable in anyone 's view ,
8_gourmet_neg_14	espescially since giving a gift basket can be time-sensitive .
8_gourmet_neg_15	Until this company gets with the program
8_gourmet_neg_16	and gets other distribution facilities I would stay away
8_gourmet_neg_17	unless you want to wait two weeks for a simple basket to be delivered .
