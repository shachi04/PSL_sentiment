9_cell_neg_1	I ` ve had this thing for two weeks .
9_cell_neg_2	Coming from the Blackberry 8700c , this phone is a big disappointment .
9_cell_neg_3	Work issued this
9_cell_neg_4	and took away the Blackberry
9_cell_neg_5	and I 'm stuck with it .
9_cell_neg_6	All I can do is whine on the Internet , so here it goes .
9_cell_neg_7	The more I use the thing the less I like it .
9_cell_neg_8	Here 's my list , good and bad .
9_cell_neg_9	\* Battery life - attrocious .

9_cell_neg_11	Trust me .
9_cell_neg_12	Grade :

9_cell_neg_14	\* Navigation - cumbersome .
9_cell_neg_15	The keys are too small ,

9_cell_neg_22	I hate it .
9_cell_neg_23	Why do applications not quit
9_cell_neg_24	when you end them ?
9_cell_neg_25	Instead they stay memory resident
9_cell_neg_26	and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager .
9_cell_neg_27	The menu is pre-loaded with goodies
9_cell_neg_28	to buy from Cingular ,
9_cell_neg_29	how convenient .

9_cell_neg_41	why this is OK .

9_cell_neg_48	Bluetooth is great .
9_cell_neg_49	\* Outlook & email - This is workable ,
9_cell_neg_50	but difficult .
9_cell_neg_51	You can write an email ,
9_cell_neg_52	you can edit your schedule and tasks ,
9_cell_neg_53	but it 's not easy .
9_cell_neg_54	"If Blackberry gets and "" A """
9_cell_neg_55	-LRB- and it does -RRB- ,
9_cell_neg_56	Blackjack gets a C .
9_cell_neg_57	It does n't synch notes , so if you ` re an Outlook Notes person
9_cell_neg_58	you ` re just left out , sorry .
9_cell_neg_59	Why ? ?

9_cell_neg_68	If you want a phone
9_cell_neg_69	that does a lot of things poorly
9_cell_neg_70	but looks nice ,
9_cell_neg_71	this could be the one for you .
