11_kitchen_pos_1	I normally do n't write reviews . . .
11_kitchen_pos_2	but after owning several toasters in the past ,
11_kitchen_pos_3	and being very disappointed ,
11_kitchen_pos_4	I just had to write about this one .
11_kitchen_pos_5	I owned an old Toastmaster 4 slice toaster for about 20 years .
11_kitchen_pos_6	It never did brown evenly , but was a workhorse
11_kitchen_pos_7	until finally the bread crumb tray broke .
11_kitchen_pos_8	Got my money 's worth .
11_kitchen_pos_9	I have done a lot of research on toasters on epinions , amazon , and others . . .
11_kitchen_pos_10	and many people have n't been very happy with toasters
11_kitchen_pos_11	they have bought
11_kitchen_pos_12	costing nearly $ 300.00
11_kitchen_pos_13	-LRB- dualit -RRB- .
11_kitchen_pos_14	Toastmaster , GE , Rival , Dualit , most Kitchenaid and Sunbeam models were poorly rated .
11_kitchen_pos_15	I found one review on this Sunbeam
11_kitchen_pos_16	-LRB- this is their top of the line model , the chrome and black model costs more ,
11_kitchen_pos_17	but currently not in production . -RRB-
11_kitchen_pos_18	and the person really really liked it .
11_kitchen_pos_19	So I ordered this from Amazon directly , this was the VERY lowest price
11_kitchen_pos_20	I could find .
11_kitchen_pos_21	Order something else so
11_kitchen_pos_22	as to get their free shipping
11_kitchen_pos_23	-LRB- over $ 25.00 -RRB-
11_kitchen_pos_24	So what happened
11_kitchen_pos_25	when I got it .
11_kitchen_pos_26	Got the toaster . . .
11_kitchen_pos_27	plugged it in . . .
11_kitchen_pos_28	dropped two slices of bread in ,
11_kitchen_pos_29	and excitedly
11_kitchen_pos_30	waited for my toast .
11_kitchen_pos_31	A few minutes passed . . .
11_kitchen_pos_32	then . . POP
11_kitchen_pos_33	its done . . . or so I thought .
11_kitchen_pos_34	When the toast came out . . .
11_kitchen_pos_35	it was brown only on one side the other side poorly toasted .
11_kitchen_pos_36	This goes for BOTH slices .
11_kitchen_pos_37	Right then and there I was ready to send this thing back .
11_kitchen_pos_38	Well . . . had been busy that week
11_kitchen_pos_39	and continued using it day
11_kitchen_pos_40	after day . . .
11_kitchen_pos_41	Each day was as disappointing as the first . . .
11_kitchen_pos_42	THEN . . .
11_kitchen_pos_43	after a little over a week . . .
11_kitchen_pos_44	The bread started toasting . . . uh . .
11_kitchen_pos_45	well PERFECTLY
11_kitchen_pos_46	After owning this for nearly 4 months . . .
11_kitchen_pos_47	it still browns evenly on BOTH sides of each piece of bread , crisp on the outside , soft on the inside .
11_kitchen_pos_48	I do n't know
11_kitchen_pos_49	why it started working right . . . would n't think
11_kitchen_pos_50	"that it would need to be "" broken in """
11_kitchen_pos_51	to work right .
11_kitchen_pos_52	I am so glad
11_kitchen_pos_53	that I did n't send this back right after the first several toastings . . .
11_kitchen_pos_54	Procrastinating worked out in my best interest , for the first time .
11_kitchen_pos_55	I have not tried Bagels in this . . .
11_kitchen_pos_56	do n't like bagels . . .
11_kitchen_pos_57	but it does well for what I bought it for .
11_kitchen_pos_58	I think
11_kitchen_pos_59	the style is rather funky ,
11_kitchen_pos_60	but many people have liked its looks .
11_kitchen_pos_61	If this toaster works for you as good
11_kitchen_pos_62	as it has for me . . .
11_kitchen_pos_63	I think
11_kitchen_pos_64	you will like it ! ! !
11_kitchen_pos_65	If it does n't work well right out of the box . . .
11_kitchen_pos_66	you might give it a few days . . .
11_kitchen_pos_67	maybe the toast fairy will bless you too .
